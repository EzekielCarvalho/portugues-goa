The question of human existence in the area of Goa was not answered until about 1993 when rock art engravings on lateritic platforms and granite boulders from Usgalimal were found on the banks of the river Kushavati River.</p>
<p  className="historytext">
Other evidences of human settlement have been the rock shelter at Usgalimal, the perennial stream of water in the vicinity, an anthropomorphic figure of mother goddess and tectiforms resembling tree-like motifs. Other things have been discovered in the Mesolithic sites of the Mandovi-Zuari basin as well as sites such as Keri, Thane, Anjuna, Mauxim, Kazur in Quepem,  Virdi. There has also been evidence of a Palaeolithic cave at Dabolim, Adkon, Shgaon, Fatorpa, Arli, Maulinguinim, Diwar, Sanguem, Pilerne, Aquem-Margaon etc.

  <p  className="historytext">


The Kushavati Shamanic culture was easily evident as a result of engravings found at Usgalimal. More than 125 forms were found dispersed along the coasts of the river Kushavati in south-eastern Goa. According to one Mr. Kamat, these are the evidences of a prehistoric Goan shamanistic practice.

The Kushavati rock art that is found in Goa were basically pictures made by cowherds. People were totally oblivious as to the age of these works neither could people interpret them. Thus after painstaking study, scholars were able to conclude that these petroglyphs differed from those found elsewhere in Goa. The nature of these petroglyphs which was rather ocular helped with giving evidence of the prehistoric shamanistic.

It was discovered further concerning the Kushavati culture, that they were hunter-gatherers, people who had knowledge about natural resources and stuff like water, fish, plants, animals, seasons, natural calamities. They were careful with water security, hence they would camp closer to the water streams. They were able to meet their provisional requirements from the jungle, again, which was near the stream. Again this culture was somewhat like cultures today in the sense that they had to go through the mysteries of illness, death, and birth. The same Mr. Kamat has the notion that this culture could be about 6000 to 8000 years old.  Dr. N. Kamat, with the help of DNA based work on human migration was able to conclude that the Kushavati shamans did not belong to the first wave of humans to arrive in Goa. He believes that they could be the early Mediterraneans who came from the Western Ghats.

  <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox id = "Prehistory: Neolithic period"  tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>Neolithic period</MDBBox></MDBTypography>
  
  <p  className="historytext">This period was evidenced by the findings of polished stone axes which were found in Goa Velha (Old Goa).
It is also believed that this was roughly the same time when tribes of Austric origin such as the Mundaris, Kols and Kharvis may have settled in Goa. They mainly depended on hunting, fishing and agriculture. One Mr. Anant Ramakrishna Dhume, who is a Goan hitorian believes that the Gauda and Kunbi and castes of this nature are modern descendents of the ancient Mundari tribes. He also mentioned that there are words in the Konkani language which are of Mundari origin. There were also the Negroids, who were food-gatherers. There are traces of Negroid physical features which can be found in parts of Goa upto to the middle of the first millennium (1000).

There were also the Konkas (from is derived the name of the region Kongvan or Konkan), who were the earliest settlers in Goa. They were a proto-australoid tribe. This was also the time when agriculture wasn't fully developed. It is learned that the people of Kol and Mundari may have been using stone and wood tools as the megalithic tribes were using iron tools as late as 1200 BC. It is believed that the Kol tribe may have migrated from Gujarat.

It was found that the people of this time would worship anthills. The people of the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian settlement also worshipped anthills interestingly. Anthill worship still continues to this day in Goa.

  The whole matter of democracy started in Goa, got its influence from the theocratic democracy of Sumer, but the main difference was that it was transformed into an oligarchic democracy wherein, instead of government being centered around a deity (a theocracy), the rule of government was instead cetered around a certain group of people within each area. This came to be the stepping stones of the modern "communidade." At that time, it was known as "Gaumkari", because it overlapped with the local practices.

Hence before any king ruled the territory, the oligarchic form of democracy existed in Goa. This form of village government was called "Gaumponn", and even though kings came and went, this form of government remained though after Portuguese rule, it came to an end. Hence the faithfulness of Goans to their village always superseded that towards the government or ruling king or minister. This continued into the Portuguese rule and was documented by them. They referred to it as the "communidade". Unfortunately, once the Portuguese rule ended, 

the activities of the village development, which were under the jurisdiction of the communidades was handed over to the gram panchayat (who are under the state government of Goa), leaving the communidades (gaunkaris) non-functional.

The 1700s and 1400s BC brought with them another wave of migrants from the Southern part of India, from the Deccan plateau particularly. The immiggrants included Kushas and Harappans who moved to Lothal around 1600 BC to escape their land from being submerged. They were fisher folk. This further influenced Goan culture.

  <p  className="historytext">This was the time when the Mauryas, whose history almost doesn't exist, came into Goa. This dynasty had kings who ruled somewhere within the 4th till the 7th century BC.
  
  Their kingdom stretched from what is today known as South Gujarat, coastal Maharashtra, Goa and approximately half of the North Kanara district. Later on, the kingdom led to the founding of another kingdom known as the Konkan Mauryas.
  
  Chandragupta Maurya was an important personality during this era. This was also the era when Buddhism was introduced into Goa. Their language resulted in the formation of early Konkani.

  <p  className="historytext">
  
  This kingdom was formed by vassals of the Mauryan empire after the Mauryan empire declined. This was also the time when they declared independence. This dynasty ruled Goa, via their coastal vassals i.e. the Chutus of Karwar.
  The duration of this dynasty's existence was roughly from 2nd century BC to 100 AD. This dynasty was able to establish contacts with the Roman empire. As this dynasty came to an end, the Bhojas strengthend themselves. It was also at this time that the profitable seaborne trade decreased. There were also Greek converts to Buddhism who settled in Goa.

  The Bhojas were originally vassals of the Mauryan empire and eventually formed an empire of their own once the Mauryan and the succeeding empire fell apart. The got to rule Goa for a whopping more than 500 years, taking over Goa as a whole. They likely began their rule somewhere in 4th century AD, and such evidence was found somewhere in Shiroda. The Bhojas had Chandor as their capital and ruled Goa, Belgaum and North Canara. The Bhojas used Sanskrit and Prakrit for thei  administration and government.

   During this era, Goa had various rulers in the form of dynasties that ruled Goa for some centuries. During this era, there was no fixed ordered judicial policing authority system in place. Hence, the state had to resort to traditional arrangements controled by absolute rulers and local chieftains. It is possible that there might have been greater order under the rule of the Muslims. It was also during this time that Goa was not ruled as a singular kingdom. Parts of the region of Goa was ruled by different kingdoms. The various dynasties which ruled during this time were the 
   Indo-Parthians, Abhiras, Batapuras, Bhojas, Chalukyas, Rastrakutas, Shilaharas, Kadambas, Yadavas, Vijayanagar Empire, and the Bahmani Sultanate etc.
