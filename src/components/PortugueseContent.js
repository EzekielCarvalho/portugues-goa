            The prominent date of the tryst of the Portuguese with Goa (India) was on 20 May 1498 when Vasco da Gama reached Calicut on the coast of Malabar.

            Vasco was able to engage in trade upon arriving to India. He invited some people to his ship and managed to trade. He was told by a Tunisian Muslim there to meet with the ruler of Calicut, the Zamorin. So he sent a couple of his men to meet him. The ruler told them that in order to trade, they would have to make the necessary payments and obtain a letter of concession. He managed to secure it though he had to leave some of his men with the ruler as security for the payment. This enraged Vasco and led him to take quite a number of natives in return. 

            It can be safe to say that Gama's trip to India was a good venture, he was able to bring in cargo worth 60 times the cost of the journey.

  <p  className="historytext">

Pedro Cabral was an important figure who sailed to India to trade for pepper and other spices, he was able to negotiate for and establish a factory in Calicut. He arrived in 13 September 1500. He faced some hardship when his factory at Kozhikode was surprisingly attacked by locals, which led to the death of more than 50 Portuguese men. As a result, Cabral was angered by the incident caused Cabral to take control of 10 Arab merchanyt ships which were docked at the harbour. He killed about 600 of their crew and annexed their cargo before burning the ships. Calicut also had his ships bombard Calicut for an entire day as a consequence for violating the agreement. However,Cabral was able to secure treaties with the local rulers at Cochin and Cannanore. Cabral started to return back to Portugal from 16 Jan 1501 and was able to reach there on 23 June 1501, unfortunately with only 4 of the 13 ships.

The Portuguese were able to build the Pulicat fort in 1502, with the aid of the Vijaynagar ruler.

Vasco da Gama was able to sail to India the second time with 15 ships and 800 men. This was after his first unfortunate encounter with the Muslims in Calicut, so this time he arrived on 30 October 1502. The ruler in Calicut was willing to sign a treaty this time instead of retaliating with ire. Gama requested that all Muslims (Arab) be thrown out from Calicut, however this request was denied. Gama was able to bombard the city and capture several rice vessels. He returned to Portugal in September 1503.

  <p  className="historytext"> Francisco was elected as the Viceroy of India, provided that he set up four forts 
  on the southwestern Indian coast, namely at Anjediva Island, Cannanore, Cochin and Quilon. He departed from Portugal with a fleet of 22 vessels with 1,500 men.

  Almeida reached Anjediva Island where he started building Fort Anjediva post haste. On 23 October, he started building Fort St. Angelo at Cannanore. He left Lourenço de Brito with 150 men and two ships to take charge of the fort.

  Almeida reached Cochin on 31st October 1505 with just 8 vessels remaining. It was there that he learned that his traders at Quilon were killed. So, he sent his son Lourenço  with 6 ships. They were able to destroy 27 Calicut vessels in the harbour of Quilon. Almeida stayed in Cochin where he was able to strengthen the Portuguese fort of Manuel.

The Muslim ruler there (the Zamorin) mustered a fleet of 200 ships to do battle with the Portuguese. However Almeida's son Lourenço was victorious in a battle at sea at the entrance to the harbour of Cannanore. This was the battle of Cannanore. This was also an important setback to the fleet of the Zamorin. Lourenço decided to explore the area south below India, which is the coastal area of Colombo, which is now in Sri Lanka. Trouble struck the Portuguese fortification when a new ruler, opposed to the Portuguese and allied to the Zamorin, attacked the said garrison. This was the siege of Cannanore.

Almeida's mission was further fortified by the coming of Tristão da Cunha's squadron. The squadron headed by Afonso de Albuquerque split from Tristão da Cunha's from the East of Africa and had begun to independently conquer territories in the Persian Gulf to the west.

Things turned out for the bad for Almeida's son Lourenço when his squadron under his command was attacked by a group of Muslims (the Mameluk Egyptian and Gujarat Sultanate fleet at Chaul and Dabul respectively), which were led by Mirocem and Meliqueaz in the battle of Chaul. The son unfortunately died in battle. The Mamluk-Indian resistance fell and was defeated at the battle of Diu.

  <p  className="historytext"> Afonso de Albuquerque became the second governor of the Portuguese territory in the east in 1509. A new fleet led by Marshal Fernão Coutinho reached with orders to destroy the power of the Zamorin in Calicut. The result was thte Zamorin's palace was captured, destroyed and the city was set ablaze. Unfortunately, in retaliation the forces of the Muslim king reunited and killed Coutinho and wounded Albuquerque. He decided to change his mind and establish a treaty with the Zamorin in 1513 to protect the Portuguese interests in Malabar. It wasn't long before beligerence erupted when an attempt was made by the Portuguese to assassinate the Zamorin sometime around 1515 and 1518. However, in 1510, Albuquerque together with the allied help of the Hindu Vijayanagar empire were able to defeat the Bijapur sultan leading to the formation of a permanent holding in Old Goa (Goa Velha). The Southern region, known as Goa, became the headquarters of Portuguese India. This was also the seat of the Portuguese viceroy who controlled the Portuguese possessions in Asia.
  
  The Portuguese managed to set up colonies in and around Mylapore. A key feature of their rule was to demolish Hindu temples and establish Catholic churches and spread Christianity to the heathens of the region. They built the Luz church in Mylapore, Madras (modern day Chennai), which was the first church built by them in 1516. In 1522, the São Tomé church was built in the place of the Kapaleeshwarar temple, which they looted and destroyed.

The Portuguese were able to acquire territories from the Sultans of Gujarat namely Damaon, Salsette, Bombay, Baçaim (Bassein), and Diu.

In 1526, the Portuguese took control of Mangalore, under the viceroyship of Lop Vaz de Sampaio. This territory included parts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi in Karnataka state, and Kasaragod in Kerala state (South Canara). Mangalore called as the islands of O Padrão de Santa Maria; later came to be known as St. Mary's Islands. The Keladi Nayaka Kingdom were able to defeat the Portuguese in 1640. The Portuguese political power in the Kanara region was destroyed by one Shvappa Nayaka, which resulted in the capturing of all the Portuguese forts of the coastal region.

Unfortunately, there were bad sides to the Portuguese rule, even though the rules were changed in the future under their rule. In 1546, the Portuguese rule sadly included the inquisition. Jesuit Missionary Francis Xavier set up the Goa Inquisition for the "new Christians" in a letter dated 16 May 1546 to King John III of Portugal. Various communities such as the Hindus, Muslims and Bene Israelis were publically persecuted by the Portuguese and the Padroado Jesuit clergy, even before the Inquisition was set up. It is important to note here that the inquisition was not limited to Goa or even India, but also included Europe where Protestants were mostly targeted. There were new Christians and Eastern Christians who were frequently wrongly accused of "Crypto-Hinduism" and "Judaising". They were the main targets of the persecution and punishment for their faith by the Padroado Jesuit prosecutors.

Bombay (Mumbai) as a dowry to Charles II of England by his wife Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza in 1661. The Maratha Confederacy in 1739 was able to take over much of the Northern Province when they attacked and robbed Fort Bassein in the Battle of Bassein. Portugal acquired Dadra and Nagar Haveli in 1779.

Due to the friendly relationship between the Portuguese and British, Goa was briefly occupied by the British from 1799 to 1813.

The capital of Goa was shifted to Panjim, which at that time (1843) was known as Nova (new) Goa. This was when it became the administrative seat of Portuguese India. The erstwhile seat and capital was Velha Goa (Old Goa), even though the viceroys lived there since 1 December 1759. 

Órfãs d'El-Rei was a term used to refer to Portuguese girl orphans. The term translates into "Orphans of the King". They were sent to overseas colonies to marry either Portuguese settlers or the natives which possessed high status.

Hence, as a result the footprint of the Portuguese spreads vastly to various parts of the world, however Goa became the capital of Portuguese Goa from 1530 all the way until the time when the Indians took over Goa and its eventual merge with India in 1961.

  <p  className="historytext">Nearing the annexation of Goa, Portugal had gone under dictatorship rule by Dr. Salazar, Hence it was a time when views were suppressed. This didn't bode too well for Goa as the number of revolts and mutinous assemblies increased. There was probably more civil unrest amongst the Hindus as compared to Catholics as Catholics had better standings in Portuguese society.
  
  On 24 July 1954 an organisation called "The United Front of Goans" seized the enclave of Dadra. The remaining territory of Nagar Haveli was taken over by the Azad Gomantak Dal on 2 August 1954. The conclusion at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, regarding access to Dadra and Nagar Haveli was a stalemate. 
  
  From 1954, the Satyagrahis (who peaceful protesters engaged in civil disobedience) against Portuguese rule, outside Goa and Damaon's borders were violently restrained through coercive force. This resulted in tensions between the newly created India and Portuguese Goa resulting in the Indian consulate's closure in Panjim and the representation of Portuguese Goa in India to seize its presence. India also imposed an official ban or trade and other commercial activity (economic embargo) against the territories of Portuguese Goa. The Indian Government  decided to rather wait and watch what would happen next from 1955 to 1961 with many representations to the Portuguese Salazar dictatorship, and made attempts to emphasize the importance of decolonisation before the international community.

The TAIP (Transportes Aéreos da Índia Portuguesa) was set up to ensure that transportation of people and goods to and from the Indian enclaves could be carried out by the Salazar dictatorship.

Portuguese rule came to an abrupt end in December 1961 unfortunately when India took the extreme step and used military action to drive the Portuguese to surrender. Such an action was extremely unfair to the people of Goa as it did not include a referendum as to whether they would want to continue being under Portuguese rule or not. This created mixed feelings from other countries in the world. Such an action also included forcefully making Indian citizens of Goans who were rightfully Portuguese. Hence this caused the Portuguese government to graciously open up a way which would benefit many Goans even today, in that they would be granted Portuguese citizenship after a thorough check on the ancestry of Goans to ensure that their relatives existed during Portuguese rule.

The military action was extremely unfair to the Portuguese who had only about 3,300 men stationed in Goa, while the Indian soldiers numbered to about 30,000 people with full air and naval support. The Governor General of Portuguese India officially surrendered on 19 December 1961.
