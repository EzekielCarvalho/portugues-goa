           <p  className="historytext">In August 2019, the cabinet agreed towards land admeasuring about 10 lakh sqm in the region of Melauli for a proposed IIT project.</p> <p>
             The census records show that about 81.38 hectares of the 1629.14 hectares of land in Melauli contains forests. Melauli is also close towards the Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary, the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary and Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary.</p> <p> As a result of being declared as an "ecologically sensitive area" of the Western Ghats by the Ministry of environment, forest and climate change, this declaration dated 27 February 2020, effectively forbids all new and expansion related projects related to buildings and constructions with the built-up area of 20000sqm.</p><p>The Melauli village consists of Shel, Dhada, Paikul, Maiguini and Murmune. These are the areas wherein wildlifers have recorded there to be various fauna such as the Sri Lankan frog mouth, Malabar pied hornbill, bison, leopard, five species of deer, Malabar giant squirrel, the king cobra etc. Besides this, there are four perennial natural springs.</p>

<p> One of the major issues in handing over this land over to the government for the project is that the village holds as many as 350 families who have farmed cashews on this land for generations.</p> <p>It was also pointed ou that if these villagers were to be shifted, that it would take them a likely estimate of 35 to 40 years to make their new location as productive as the present land where the infrastructure is already in place.</p>

   <p>The Western Ghats covers the areas that are included in the planned site of the IIT campus. This is a natural biosphere containing a very thick forest cover and many local and often endangered species of fauna. Huge areas of this forest cover may have to be levelled in order to clear sufficient space for the construction of the campus.</p>

<p>The Goa government finally decided to withdraw the project from the proposed site but not scrap the project altogether. In the future, the location of the project will be decided.</p>

<p>“The decision to shift the IIT project was taken keeping in mind peoples' sentiments and the request of health minister Vishwajit Rane, who is the local MLA, and local representatives.

<p>The whole decision to cancel the project at Melauli is climax of about six months of agitation by the residents which only exacerbated over time. On January 6, the villagers locked heads with the police when the land was demarcated. The conflict resulted in the residents being lathicharged and exposed to tear gas. The CM had the final say in concluding that the villagers in Melauli were "misguided". He claimed that the project was a non-polluting project with the aim of education. He endeavoured to convince the people but according to him, "some people" worked against the interests of the state. Mr. Sawant claimed that neither he nor Mr. Rane had any "personal interest" in the project.</p>

<p>This incident sheds light to the world on uniting together to fight against climate change, and indeed it wasn't unnoticed.</p>

<p>It is questionable as to why the CM decided to kowtow to the will of the people. There is possibility that the CM may have had his own personal agenda in mind by withdrawing the project from Melauli, with the upcoming elections in 2022, but God knows?</p>
