Muito Prazer. It's a pleasure to have you visit. This website was made with the sole intention\r\n          to make unbiased news and history related to Goa available to the general public. There has been a lot of biased information\r\n          given concerning and justifying the forced annexation of Goa into the Indian Union without any referendum. So I felt it best\r\n          to bring out the facts of the situation of the history of Goa. It is said that the Portuguese rule was far better (though not perfect)\r\n          than the present Indian rule. The Portuguese ruled for more than 400 years while the Indian ruled has been less than 100 years\r\n          and already their rule has seen protests to the present day as a result of the present Indian Government having a more undemocratic\r\n          stance on carrying out its own agenda rather than listening to the will of the people.

Understanding the operations of people and societies is difficult, though a number of disciplines make the attempt. An exclusive reliance on current data would needlessly handicap our efforts. How can we evaluate war if the nation is at peace—unless we use historical materials? How can we understand genius, the influence of technological innovation, or the role that beliefs play in shaping family life, if we don't use what we know about experiences in the past? Some social scientists attempt to formulate laws or theories about human behavior. But even these recourses depend on historical information, except for in limited, often artificial cases in which experiments can be devised to determine how people act. Major aspects of a society's operation, like mass elections, missionary activities, or military alliances, cannot be set up as precise experiments. Consequently, history must serve, however imperfectly, as our laboratory, and data from the past must serve as our most vital evidence in the unavoidable quest to figure out why our complex species behaves as it does in societal settings. This, fundamentally, is why we cannot stay away from history: it offers the only extensive evidential base for the contemplation and analysis of how societies function, and people need to have some sense of how societies function simply to run their own lives.</p>\r\n          \r\n          <MDBRow>\r\n          <MDBCol   size=\"12\"  md=\"6\"><MDBCol>\r\n            <MDBView hover zoom>\r\n              <img\r\n                src=\"https://nzhistory.govt.nz/files/styles/fullsize/public/images/portugal_0.jpg?itok=JFil9940\"\r\n          \r\n                alt=\"\"\r\n              />\r\n          \r\n         \r\n            </MDBView>\r\n          </MDBCol></MDBCol>\r\n\r\n          <MDBCol   size=\"12\"  md=\"6\"><MDBCol>\r\n            <MDBView hover zoom>\r\n              <img\r\n                src=\"https://riverwalkjazz.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Singing_GIs.jpg\"\r\n          \r\n                alt=\"\"\r\n              />\r\n             \r\n         \r\n            </MDBView>\r\n          </MDBCol></MDBCol> </MDBRow>\r\n\r\n          <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>History Helps Us Understand Change and How the Society We Live in Came to Be</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\nThe second reason history is inescapable as a subject of serious study follows closely on the first. The past causes the present, and so the future. Any time we try to know why something happened—whether a shift in political party dominance in the American Congress, a major change in the teenage suicide rate, or a war in the Balkans or the Middle East—we have to look for factors that took shape earlier. Sometimes fairly recent history will suffice to explain a major development, but often we need to look further back to identify the causes of change. Only through studying history can we grasp how things change; only through history can we begin to comprehend the factors that cause change; and only through history can we understand what elements of an institution or a society persist despite change.</p>\r\n\r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>The Importance of History in Our Own Lives</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">These two fundamental reasons for studying history underlie more specific and quite diverse uses of history in our own lives. History well told is beautiful. Many of the historians who most appeal to the general reading public know the importance of dramatic and skillful writing—as well as of accuracy. Biography and military history appeal in part because of the tales they contain. History as art and entertainment serves a real purpose, on aesthetic grounds but also on the level of human understanding. Stories well done are stories that reveal how people and societies have actually functioned, and they prompt thoughts about the human experience in other times and places. The same aesthetic and humanistic goals inspire people to immerse themselves in efforts to reconstruct quite remote pasts, far removed from immediate, present-day utility. Exploring what historians sometimes call the \"pastness of the past\"—the ways people in distant ages constructed their lives—involves a sense of beauty and excitement, and ultimately another perspective on human life and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<MDBRow>\r\n          <MDBCol   size=\"12\"  md=\"6\"><MDBCol>\r\n            <MDBView hover zoom>\r\n              <img\r\n                src=\"https://www.manxgamingsolutions.com/uploads/1/1/8/8/118807775/portuguese-soldiers-17th-cent_orig.jpg\"\r\n          \r\n                alt=\"\"\r\n              />\r\n\r\n<MDBMask className=\"flex-center\" overlay=\"green-strong\">\r\n                <p className=\"white-text\">Portuguese Restoration War</p>\r\n              </MDBMask>\r\n                \r\n         \r\n            </MDBView>\r\n          </MDBCol></MDBCol>\r\n\r\n          <MDBCol   size=\"12\"  md=\"5\"><MDBCol>\r\n            <MDBView hover zoom>\r\n              <img\r\n                src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a2/a2/d6/a2a2d6f1d51a0c1995173b1bfdad9633.png\"\r\n          \r\n                alt=\"\"\r\n                \r\n              />\r\n\r\n<MDBMask className=\"flex-center\" overlay=\"green-strong\">\r\n                <p className=\"white-text\">Portuguese Calvary</p>\r\n              </MDBMask>\r\n                \r\n         \r\n            </MDBView>\r\n            \r\n          </MDBCol></MDBCol> </MDBRow>\r\n\r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>History Contributes to Moral Understanding</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">History also provides a terrain for moral contemplation. Studying the stories of individuals and situations in the past allows a student of history to test his or her own moral sense, to hone it against some of the real complexities individuals have faced in difficult settings. People who have weathered adversity not just in some work of fiction, but in real, historical circumstances can provide inspiration. \"History teaching by example\" is one phrase that describes this use of a study of the past—a study not only of certifiable heroes, the great men and women of history who successfully worked through moral dilemmas, but also of more ordinary people who provide lessons in courage, diligence, or constructive protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title' id = \"provisions\">History Provides Identity</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">History also helps provide identity, and this is unquestionably one of the reasons all modern nations encourage its teaching in some form. Historical data include evidence about how families, groups, institutions and whole countries were formed and about how they have evolved while retaining cohesion. For many Americans, studying the history of one's own family is the most obvious use of history, for it provides facts about genealogy and (at a slightly more complex level) a basis for understanding how the family has interacted with larger historical change. Family identity is established and confirmed. Many institutions, businesses, communities, and social units, such as ethnic groups in the United States, use history for similar identity purposes. Merely defining the group in the present pales against the possibility of forming an identity based on a rich past. And of course nations use identity history as well—and sometimes abuse it. Histories that tell the national story, emphasizing distinctive features of the national experience, are meant to drive home an understanding of national values and a commitment to national loyalty.</p>\r\n\r\n<MDBRow >\r\n\r\n<MDBCol id=\"\" size=\"12\" md=\"12\">   <MDBView   className=\"z-depth-5\" hover>\r\n\r\n<ParallaxBanner  id=\"vu\"\r\nclassName=\"your-class\"\r\nlayers={[\r\n{\r\nimage: 'https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BG-portuguese-navy-1024x445.jpg',\r\namount: 0.5,\r\n},\r\n{\r\nimage: 'https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BG-portuguese-navy-1024x445.jpg',\r\namount: 0.2,\r\n},\r\n]}\r\nstyle={{\r\nheight: '500px',\r\n}}\r\n>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</ParallaxBanner> \r\n</MDBView></MDBCol>\r\n\r\n</MDBRow>\r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>Studying History Is Essential for Good Citizenship</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">A study of history is essential for good citizenship. This is the most common justification for the place of history in school curricula. Sometimes advocates of citizenship history hope merely to promote national identity and loyalty through a history spiced by vivid stories and lessons in individual success and morality. But the importance of history for citizenship goes beyond this narrow goal and can even challenge it at some points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">History that lays the foundation for genuine citizenship returns, in one sense, to the essential uses of the study of the past. History provides data about the emergence of national institutions, problems, and values—it's the only significant storehouse of such data available. It offers evidence also about how nations have interacted with other societies, providing international and comparative perspectives essential for responsible citizenship. Further, studying history helps us understand how recent, current, and prospective changes that affect the lives of citizens are emerging or may emerge and what causes are involved. More important, studying history encourages habits of mind that are vital for responsible public behavior, whether as a national or community leader, an informed voter, a petitioner, or a simple observer.</p>\r\n\r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>What Skills Does a Student of History Develop?</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">What does a well-trained student of history, schooled to work on past materials and on case studies in social change, learn how to do? The list is manageable, but it contains several overlapping categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">The Ability to Assess Evidence. The study of history builds experience in dealing with and assessing various kinds of evidence—the sorts of evidence historians use in shaping the most accurate pictures of the past that they can. Learning how to interpret the statements of past political leaders—one kind of evidence—helps form the capacity to distinguish between the objective and the self-serving among statements made by present-day political leaders. Learning how to combine different kinds of evidence—public statements, private records, numerical data, visual materials—develops the ability to make coherent arguments based on a variety of data. This skill can also be applied to information encountered in everyday life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">The Ability to Assess Conflicting Interpretations. Learning history means gaining some skill in sorting through diverse, often conflicting interpretations. Understanding how societies work—the central goal of historical study—is inherently imprecise, and the same certainly holds true for understanding what is going on in the present day. Learning how to identify and evaluate conflicting interpretations is an essential citizenship skill for which history, as an often-contested laboratory of human experience, provides training. This is one area in which the full benefits of historical study sometimes clash with the narrower uses of the past to construct identity. Experience in examining past situations provides a constructively critical sense that can be applied to partisan claims about the glories of national or group identity. The study of history in no sense undermines loyalty or commitment, but it does teach the need for assessing arguments, and it provides opportunities to engage in debate and achieve perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">Experience in Assessing Past Examples of Change. Experience in assessing past examples of change is vital to understanding change in society today—it's an essential skill in what we are regularly told is our \"ever-changing world.\" Analysis of change means developing some capacity for determining the magnitude and significance of change, for some changes are more fundamental than others. Comparing particular changes to relevant examples from the past helps students of history develop this capacity. The ability to identify the continuities that always accompany even the most dramatic changes also comes from studying history, as does the skill to determine probable causes of change. Learning history helps one figure out, for example, if one main factor—such as a technological innovation or some deliberate new policy—accounts for a change or whether, as is more commonly the case, a number of factors combine to generate the actual change that occurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">Historical study, in sum, is crucial to the promotion of that elusive creature, the well-informed citizen. It provides basic factual information about the background of our political institutions and about the values and problems that affect our social well-being. It also contributes to our capacity to use evidence, assess interpretations, and analyze change and continuities. No one can ever quite deal with the present as the historian deals with the past—we lack the perspective for this feat; but we can move in this direction by applying historical habits of mind, and we will function as better citizens in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<MDBRow >\r\n\r\n<MDBCol id=\"\" size=\"12\" md=\"12\">   <MDBView   className=\"z-depth-5\" hover>\r\n\r\n<ParallaxBanner  id=\"vu\"\r\nclassName=\"your-class\"\r\nlayers={[\r\n{\r\nimage: 'https://www.anratechnologies.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/history.jpg',\r\namount: 0.5,\r\n},\r\n{\r\nimage: 'https://www.anratechnologies.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/history.jpg',\r\namount: 0.2,\r\n},\r\n]}\r\nstyle={{\r\nheight: '500px',\r\n}}\r\n>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<MDBMask className=\"flex-center\" overlay=\"green-strong\">\r\n  <p className= \"text\" ></p>\r\n</MDBMask>\r\n</ParallaxBanner> \r\n</MDBView></MDBCol>\r\n\r\n</MDBRow>\r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>History Is Useful in the World of Work</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n\r\n <p  className=\"historytext\">History is useful for work. Its study helps create good businesspeople, professionals, and political leaders. The number of explicit professional jobs for historians is considerable, but most people who study history do not become professional historians. Professional historians teach at various levels, work in museums and media centers, do historical research for businesses or public agencies, or participate in the growing number of historical consultancies. These categories are important—indeed vital—to keep the basic enterprise of history going, but most people who study history use their training for broader professional purposes. Students of history find their experience directly relevant to jobs in a variety of careers as well as to further study in fields like law and public administration. Employers often deliberately seek students with the kinds of capacities historical study promotes. The reasons are not hard to identify: students of history acquire, by studying different phases of the past and different societies in the past, a broad perspective that gives them the range and flexibility required in many work situations. They develop research skills, the ability to find and evaluate sources of information, and the means to identify and evaluate diverse interpretations. Work in history also improves basic writing and speaking skills and is directly relevant to many of the analytical requirements in the public and private sectors, where the capacity to identify, assess, and explain trends is essential. Historical study is unquestionably an asset for a variety of work and professional situations, even though it does not, for most students, lead as directly to a particular job slot, as do some technical fields. But history particularly prepares students for the long haul in their careers, its qualities helping adaptation and advancement beyond entry-level employment. There is no denying that in our society many people who are drawn to historical study worry about relevance. In our changing economy, there is concern about job futures in most fields. Historical training is not, however, an indulgence; it applies directly to many careers and can clearly help us in our working lives.</p>\r\n           </MDBCol>\r\n            \r\n           \r\n          </MDBRow>\r\n  \r\n          <MDBCol size=\"12\" md=\"12\">  \r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='warning'>\r\n<MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} id = \"references\" className='bq-title'>References:</MDBBox> </MDBTypography>\r\n<p></p>\r\n</MDBCol>\r\n\r\n<MDBRow>\r\n<MDBCol > <MDBTypography note noteColor='warning'>  <MDBTypography blockquote className=\"text-left\">\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.historytoday.com/archive/head-head/what-history\" target=\"_blank\">What is History?</a></li>\r\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.valdosta.edu/history/documents/what-is-history.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">What is History?

Other things have been discovered in the Mesolithic sites of the Mandovi-Zuari basin as well as sites such as Keri, Thane, Anjuna, Mauxim, Kazur in Quepem,  Virdi. There has also been evidence of a Palaeolithic cave at Dabolim, Adkon, Shgaon, Fatorpa, Arli, Maulinguinim, Diwar, Sanguem, Pilerne, Aquem-Margaon etc.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n          \r\n            \r\n          \r\n  \r\n            <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox id = \"Prehistory: Kushavati Shamanic culture\" tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>  Kushavati Shamanic culture</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kushavati Shamanic culture was easily evident as a result of engravings found at Usgalimal. More than 125 forms were found dispersed along the coasts of the river Kushavati in south-eastern Goa. According to one Mr. Kamat, these are the evidences of a prehistoric Goan shamanistic practice.\r\n\r\nThe Kushavati rock art that is found in Goa were basically pictures made by cowherds. People were totally oblivious as to the age of these works neither could people interpret them. Thus after painstaking study, scholars were able to conclude that these petroglyphs differed from those found elsewhere in Goa. The nature of these petroglyphs which was rather ocular helped with giving evidence of the prehistoric shamanistic.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered further concerning the Kushavati culture, that they were hunter-gatherers, people who had knowledge about natural resources and stuff like water, fish, plants, animals, seasons, natural calamities. They were careful with water security, hence they would camp closer to the water streams. They were able to meet their provisional requirements from the jungle, again, which was near the stream. Again this culture was somewhat like cultures today in the sense that they had to go through the mysteries of illness, death, and birth. The same Mr. Kamat has the notion that this culture could be about 6000 to 8000 years old.  Dr. N. Kamat, with the help of DNA based work on human migration was able to conclude that the Kushavati shamans did not belong to the first wave of humans to arrive in Goa. He believes that they could be the early Mediterraneans who came from the Western Ghats.\r\n\r\n </p>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox id = \"Prehistory: Neolithic period\"  tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>Neolithic period</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n  \r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\">This period was evidenced by the findings of polished stone axes which were found in Goa Velha (Old Goa).\r\nIt is also believed that this was roughly the same time when tribes of Austric origin such as the Mundaris, Kols and Kharvis may have settled in Goa. They mainly depended on hunting, fishing and agriculture. One Mr. Anant Ramakrishna Dhume, who is a Goan hitorian believes that the Gauda and Kunbi and castes of this nature are modern descendents of the ancient Mundari tribes. He also mentioned that there are words in the Konkani language which are of Mundari origin. There were also the Negroids, who were food-gatherers. There are traces of Negroid physical features which can be found in parts of Goa upto to the middle of the first millennium (1000).\r\n\r\nThere were also the Konkas (from is derived the name of the region Kongvan or Konkan), who were the earliest settlers in Goa. They were a proto-australoid tribe. This was also the time when agriculture wasn't fully developed. It is learned that the people of Kol and Mundari may have been using stone and wood tools as the megalithic tribes were using iron tools as late as 1200 BC. It is believed that the Kol tribe may have migrated from Gujarat.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the people of this time would worship anthills. The people of the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian settlement also worshipped anthills interestingly. Anthill worship still continues to this day in Goa.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n         \r\n  \r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='success'>\r\n              <MDBBox id = \"Iron Age (from 16th century BCE): The Formations of Gaumkaris and the self rule\"  tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>Iron Age (from 16th century BCE)</MDBBox> </MDBTypography>\r\n            <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>The Formations of Gaumkaris and the self rule</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n  \r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n  The whole matter of democracy started in Goa, got its influence from the theocratic democracy of Sumer, but the main difference was that it was transformed into an oligarchic democracy wherein, instead of government being centered around a deity (a theocracy), the rule of government was instead cetered around a certain group of people within each area. This came to be the stepping stones of the modern \"communidade.\" At that time, it was known as \"Gaumkari\", because it overlapped with the local practices.\r\n\r\nHence before any king ruled the territory, the oligarchic form of democracy existed in Goa. This form of village government was called \"Gaumponn\", and even though kings came and went, this form of government remained though after Portuguese rule, it came to an end. Hence the faithfulness of Goans to their village always superseded that towards the government or ruling king or minister. This continued into the Portuguese rule and was documented by them. They referred to it as the \"communidade\". Unfortunately, once the Portuguese rule ended, \r\n\r\nthe activities of the village development, which were under the jurisdiction of the communidades was handed over to the gram panchayat (who are under the state government of Goa), leaving the communidades (gaunkaris) non-functional.\r\n\r\nThe 1700s and 1400s BC brought with them another wave of migrants from the Southern part of India, from the Deccan plateau particularly. The immiggrants included Kushas and Harappans who moved to Lothal around 1600 BC to escape their land from being submerged. They were fisher folk. This further influenced Goan culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox id = \"Iron Age (from 16th century BCE):The Mauryas (322 - 185 BCE)\"  tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>The Mauryas (322 - 185 BCE)</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n  \r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\">This was the time when the Mauryas, whose history almost doesn't exist, came into Goa. This dynasty had kings who ruled somewhere within the 4th till the 7th century BC.\r\n  \r\n  Their kingdom stretched from what is today known as South Gujarat, coastal Maharashtra, Goa and approximately half of the North Kanara district. Later on, the kingdom led to the founding of another kingdom known as the Konkan Mauryas.\r\n  \r\n  Chandragupta Maurya was an important personality during this era. This was also the era when Buddhism was introduced into Goa. Their language resulted in the formation of early Konkani.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox id = \"Iron Age (from 16th century BCE): The Satavahanas (c. 2nd century BCE to 2nd CE)\"  tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>The Satavahanas (c. 2nd century BCE to 2nd CE)</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n  \r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n  \r\n  This kingdom was formed by vassals of the Mauryan empire after the Mauryan empire declined. This was also the time when they declared independence. This dynasty ruled Goa, via their coastal vassals i.e. the Chutus of Karwar.\r\n  The duration of this dynasty's existence was roughly from 2nd century BC to 100 AD. This dynasty was able to establish contacts with the Roman empire. As this dynasty came to an end, the Bhojas strengthend themselves. It was also at this time that the profitable seaborne trade decreased.

It is possible that there might have been greater order under the rule of the Muslims. It was also during this time that Goa was not ruled as a singular kingdom. Parts of the region of Goa was ruled by different kingdoms. The various dynasties which ruled during this time were the \r\n   Indo-Parthians, Abhiras, Batapuras, Bhojas, Chalukyas, Rastrakutas, Shilaharas, Kadambas, Yadavas, Vijayanagar Empire, and the Bahmani Sultanate etc.\r\n   </p>\r\n             </MDBCol>\r\n              \r\n             \r\n            </MDBRow>\r\n    \r\n            <MDBCol size=\"12\" md=\"12\">  \r\n  <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='warning'>\r\n  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} id = \"references\" className='bq-title'>References:</MDBBox> </MDBTypography>\r\n  <p></p>\r\n  </MDBCol>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBRow>\r\n  <MDBCol > <MDBTypography note noteColor='warning'>  <MDBTypography blockquote className=\"text-left\">\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Goa\" target=\"_blank\">History of Goa</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comunidades_of_Goa\" target=\"_blank\">Comunidades of Goa</a></li>\r\n   \r\n  </ul>  </MDBTypography></MDBTypography></MDBCol></MDBRow>\r\n  \r\n  </MDBContainer> \r\n  );\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  export default gridExamplesPage;","D:\\Udemy courses\\HTML5, CSS3, Jquery, Javascript\\Projects\\React project website\\goa-porto-1\\src\\components\\PostPortugueseContent.js",["312","313","314","315","316","317","318","319","320","321","322","323","324","325","326","327","328","329","330","331","332","333","334","335","336","337","338","339","340","341","342","343","344","345","346","347","348","349","350","351","352","353"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { MDBTypography, MDBContainer, MDBRow, MDBCol, MDBBox } from \"mdbreact\";\r\nimport './PostPortugueseContent.css'; //Import here your file style\r\nimport { ParallaxBanner } from 'react-scroll-parallax';\r\nimport { MDBMask, MDBView} from \"mdbreact\";\r\n\r\nconst gridExamplesPage = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n  <MDBContainer   className=\"\">\r\n    <MDBRow >\r\n  \r\n      <MDBCol id=\"historyindex\" size=\"12\" md=\"12\">   <MDBView   className=\"z-depth-5\" hover>\r\n  \r\n  <ParallaxBanner  id=\"vu\"\r\n  className=\"your-class\"\r\n  layers={[\r\n  {\r\n    image: 'http://www.bananaburp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bb_india_portuguese_passport.jpg',\r\n    amount: 0.5,\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    image: 'http://www.bananaburp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bb_india_portuguese_passport.jpg',\r\n    amount: 0.2,\r\n  },\r\n  ]}\r\n  style={{\r\n  height: '500px',\r\n  }}\r\n  >\r\n  \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      </ParallaxBanner> \r\n    </MDBView></MDBCol>\r\n      \r\n    </MDBRow>\r\n   \r\n    \r\n    <MDBRow>\r\n              <MDBCol id = \"Forceful change of citizenship\"  md=\"12\">\r\n            <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>Forceful change of citizenship</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n  \r\n            <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n            \r\n            The Indian Government after taking over of the Portuguese territories had power as a result of the Citizenship Act of 1955, to define citizenship of the inhabitants of these regions, as with the whole of free India.

The UNSC resolution S/5033 was passed in the 988th meeting on 18.Dec.61 with 7 members out of 11 voting in favour of the motion calling for India to withdraw its forces from Goa to its pre 17.Dec.61 position which was vetoed by USSR, a permanent member. Some UNSC members, at that time, were also frustrated with Portugal for not respecting the UN resolutions, and in the bargain, Goa became the unfortunate victim of these frustrations and vindictiveness towards Portugal. India benefited from these disagreements and frustrations of the member nations and went scot free with the murder of the Charter. The Goa instance is perhaps the only instance in the history of the UN compared to other instances of nations conducting themselves in similar aggressive manner against the UN Charter. Since 1961 several incidents similar to Goa like Falkland Islands, East Timor and Kuwait have taken place, and the UN has dealt with them decisively under the Charter. But the Goa matter which has been brought up repeatedly in the UN debates, was itself improperly handled making it difficult to understand as to how the august UN allowed itself to strike Goa out of the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, to rebuff the Goan delegation of 4 to the Trusteeship Committee, and to attempt to expunge their testimony from the UN records, which was luckily stayed, thanks to some friendly nation members, and finally, the entry into the UN Year Book of 1962 that Goa was nationally REUNITED with India. The aim of the UN Charter is “Peace” but the continuing resultant “Torment” being suffered by the Goans over the past 56 years continues to be, and ever will be held against the UN by future generations and questioned by legal professionals the world over. Therefore there is an urgent need for the current members of the UN to review the matter of Goa’s invasion and continuing illegal occupation by India so that Goans can finally get the ultimate justice and closure. As said by President Bush of the USA, the actions of the UNGA in handling this petition will prove to the entire world whether it is going to be relevant or whether it is going to be a league of nations, irrelevant.</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\nThe petitioners hereby also state that the detailed original draft of this petition could not be loaded on the change.org online petition website due to the website's text space limitations, as a result, only the summary of the salient parts was possible to be loaded, which is listed below:</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n1. INDIA WAS BORN ONLY IN 1947: Until the year 1858 the Indian subcontinent was politically fragmented and comprised of over 560 princely states ruled by indigenous rulers. From 1858 onwards the British captured most of these princely states and formed a unified India, officially a British colony till 1947. The Republic of India was formed in 1947 after it gained independence from the British. </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n 2. PROOF OF GOA’S SOVEREIGNTY vis-à-vis UN & INDIA’s ACCEPTANCE: Although geographically contained in the Indian subcontinent, Goa was already politically established as “Estado da India” and was in continuous existence for 451 years since the year 1510, under Portuguese rule and was neither a part of the British Colony nor a part of India, because India did not exist until 1947. The Republic of India subsequently became a member of the United Nations and exchanged diplomatic missions with Portugal on 12th August 1948.</p>\r\n <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\na) India held its General Consulate in Goa till 1955. This is prima facie proof that Goa was recognized by India as a sovereign country. If Goa was an Indian Territory, India would not have had diplomatic relations with its own territory. </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\nb) India through its Charge d'Affaires in Lisbon, in aide-memoire, requested Portugal to transfer to itself its sovereignty in Goa. This was Indian admission that sovereignty lied with Portugal contrary to its false claims during the UNSC meetings 987 and 988 of 18.Dec.61</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\nc) The ICJ had on 12.Apr.60 ruled in the “Right of Passage Case” that India had no right of claim on the enclaves of Dadra and Nagar Aveli, parts of Damão district, a dependency of Goa and Portugal’s right to passage in exercise of its sovereignty.  </p> <p  className=\"historytext\"> <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=E7Qrc4Z-ZdAC&q=consulate#v=snippet&q=consulate&f=false\" target=\"_blank\">Indian General Consulate in Goa</a>  </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/32/032-19600412-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">International Court of Justice</a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n3.  INDIA SUPPORTED GOA AS “NON-SELF GOVERNING TERRITORY”: On 15.Dec.60 the UN declared Goa and all Portuguese colonies as Non-Self-Governing Territories (qualifying for self-determination or plebiscite), in light of the provisions of Chapter XI of the Charter, UNGA resolution 742 (VIII) and principles approved in resolution 1542 (XV) on the recommendations of the ad hoc Committee of Six elected by UNGA vide resolution 1467 (XIV) of 12.Dec.59. Indian Ambassador to UN Mr. Chandra. S. Jha was President of the committee who did not claim Goa as Indian territory and voted in favour of the resolution. </p> <p  className=\"historytext\">   <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/1542(XV)\" target=\"_blank\">UN Resolution 1542</a>  </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/142/90/IMG/NR014290.pdf?OpenElement\" target=\"_blank\">UN Resolution 1467</a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n4.

In the preamble of the draft resolution, Article 1 (2) was recalled and the principle of self-determination by the people of Goa debated. The majority resolution was defeated by the Soviet veto–the 99th cast by the USSR in the UNSC as a favour to India.        </p> <p  className=\"historytext\">   <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/sc/repertoire/59-63/Chapter%208/59-63_08-17-Complaint%20by%20Portugal%20(Goa).pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Portuguese Complaint to the UN</a>  </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">   <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/5033\" target=\"_blank\">UN Security Council Resolution S/5033</a>  </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/sc/repertoire/59-63/59-63_12.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">UN Security Council Record</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n5.   INDIA ILLEGALLY INVADED GOA CLAIMING IT AS INDIAN TERRITORY: India in violation of the sovereign rights of Portugal, the UN Charter, and world order, illegally conquered, occupied and annexed Goa on 19.Dec.61. India fabricated a false claim that since Goa was geographically a part of the Indian subcontinent, it was Indian Territory, and that India had a right to put an end to the Portuguese colonial rule unilaterally and illegally, ignoring the fact that a year earlier it had voted in favor of including Goa in the UN list of Non Self Governing Territories. This principle, if accepted would permit Panama, to occupy the Canal Zone, or Spain to seize Gibraltar and Alaska to be a part of Canada. If geography should be the criteria for such claims, there is no justification for the existence of Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal and other nations in the Indian subcontinent. Sri Lanka is inhabited by a substantial population of Indian origin which was violently fighting for independent North Eastern areas for decades as Tamil Elam, with massive casualties. Indian religious Hindu texts also document religious ties with Shri Lanka from Vedic times. India even sent a Peace Keeping Force to Sri Lanka but never suggested nor claimed it to be Indian Territory. At no time in history was the Indian subcontinent politically united, because historically, there were Hindu empires and kingdoms just as there were Moghul, Bahamani and other empires and kingdoms, and, lastly there was the empire of British India. None of all these empires and kingdoms ever extended over the entire geographical region today known as India. India grew out of a part of the former British India which only held a part of the Indian subcontinent. However the very description of Goa as a \"foreign pocket\" always showed that the territory was all the time regarded by the people of India and their political leaders as a foreign territory and not a part of India. Goa had nothing to do with the old British Indian Empire. The Chicanery and trickery which India’s UN representative Mr. Jha imputed on Portugal were actually acts committed by India, because behind the violent occupation of Goa also stood India’s economic interest as Goa's export of iron ore would yearly add 212 Million Rupees to the Indian Treasury to build up its money reserves from only 982 Million Rupees according to \"Der Spiegel\" the West German magazine. There were also rumours that NATO was to set up a base in Goa in alliance with Portugal, This probably prompted India to make a pre-emptive strike on Goa. India sent an invasion force of 46,000 troops, jet bombers, fighter planes, an aircraft carrier, cruisers, destroyers and anti-submarine frigates to overwhelm Goa’s 3,500 Portuguese ill trained and worst equipped defenders, violating all norms of morality. India’s claim that the Portuguese had fortified their defences with 25,000 troops with modern NATO weapons were proven to be blatant lies. This can be verified from the report filed from Goa by acclaimed NBC Bureau Chief Mr. Putnam Welles Hangen an American hero and Ex-First Lieutenant buried on his death after a 21 gun salute in Arlington National Cemetery, USA.  </p><p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"https://portugueseindia.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/the-dirty-game-played-by-v-k-krishna-menon-against-goa/\" target=\"_blank\">American Report from Goa by Putnam Wells Hangen</a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n6.  INDIAN ARROGANCE & INSULTS AT THE UN: India got its own independence by preaching nonviolence and ‘Peaceful Satyagraha’ to the world, but the same India soon turned into a forceful and arrogant invader showing its true colours through insults and defiance of even the UN when Mr. C S Jha, Indian Ambassador stated at the UNSC 987th meeting Quote “The invasion of Goa is a question of getting rid of the last vestiges of colonialism in India. That is a matter of faith for us. Whatever anyone else may think, Charter or no Charter, Council or no Council, that is our basic faith which we cannot afford to give up at any cost” Unquote. Krishna Menon, the then Indian Defence Minister boasted Quote “Had the Security Council intervened, we would not have stopped the action (to take Goa by military force). We had learned some lessons. ….The nation that behaves well is always in a bad position” Unquote. Mr. Jha also stated in the UNSC, Quote “International Law should be cast into the dustbin of history and its founders, Grotius, Bodin and the rest of the great family, should be relegated to the museums because they were Europeans whom my country does not like” Unquote. The same India is now going around the world like a wolf in sheep’s clothing seeking support from the very same USA and Western and European countries it defied and insulted and did not like, to get a permanent seat at the UNSC. India now wants the world community to reward an aggressor for its open and arrogant contempt for the Charter, International law and its subordination. This is the same Indian delegate, member of the ad hoc Committee of ‘Six’ of the UNGA who had earlier voted to include Goa in the list of “Non-Self-Governing Territories” now voicing an “India does not care for the United Nations” attitude. India in a display of arrogance, admitted to illegally executing the commitment of the UN of eliminating colonial regimes by forcefully annexing one of them by war and disrupting world peace against the Charter. India was gaining legitimacy through defiance of the Charter. It is clear that Mr. Jha resorted to false syllogisms and sophistry in his arguments and the world community saw through those arguments for what they were to vote against India’s action in Goa.                         </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"https://portugueseindia.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/the-dirty-game-played-by-v-k-krishna-menon-against-goa/\" target=\"_blank\">UN Security Council 987th Meeting Record dated 18th Dec 1961</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/82196/S_PV.988-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y%C2%A0\" target=\"_blank\">UN Securit Council 988th Meeting Record dated 18th Dec 1961</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"https://hosted.law.wisc.edu/wordpress/wilj/files/2012/02/berman1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">India's Legitimacy through Defiance</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://cdn.un.org/unyearbook/yun/chapter_pdf/1969YUN/1969_P1_SEC1_CH7.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">India Not Ashamed remark of Mr. C.

INDIA CRITICIZED BY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: A host of countries including the United States, England, Australia, France, Germany, Canada, Spain, Netherlands, New Zealand and Pakistan criticized India at the time for preaching non-violence to the world but indulging in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the Geneva Convention by using brutal military force in Goa. Referring to the perception, especially in the West, that India had previously been lecturing to the world about the virtues of nonviolence, US President J. F. Kennedy told the Indian ambassador to the US, Quote “You spend the last fifteen years preaching morality to us, and then you go ahead and act the way any normal country would behave.... the preacher was caught coming out of a brothel’ Unquote, clearly hinting at the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru’s rhetoric on non-violence. </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/group/tomzgroup/pmwiki/uploads/1074-1962-03-KS-b-RCW.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">International Reaction to Goa Invasion</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1963-pt19/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1963-pt19-5-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Goa Invasion - US Congressional Record</a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n    </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n8.   ABDICATION OF DUTY BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL: After the Soviet veto, the UNSC totally abdicated its duty and ignored the matter of illegal occupation of Goa by India. The vetoed resolution was for cessation of hostilities, withdrawal of Indian forces, and a solution to differences between India and Portugal through peaceful means. The veto did not permit India to take unilateral action to invade Goa. The veto also in no way obstructed, stopped nor hindered the UNSC from taking steps against India for invading and annexing Goa by force against Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant as well as Articles 75-85 of UN Charter especially as Goa was a Non Self Governing Territory.</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n9.  INVASION & ANNEXATION OF GOA IS ILLEGAL AS PER LAW & CHARTER: In order for its use of force in Goa to be considered legal under the UN Charter, India had to argue one of three points:</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\na) Its use of force was not “against” any other state, because Goa was really a part of India,</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\nb) Its use of force had the approval of the Security Council; or</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\nc) Its use of force was in self-defence to a Portuguese “armed attack”.</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n     Unfortunately for India, it pursued the first line of argument. Its delegate in the Security Council debates argued without citing specific laws, that it was the colonization of Goa by Portugal that was illegal and thus Goa was not Portuguese. Defence Minister of India argued, “India had not violated any one’s territorial integrity” Unfortunately for India, just a year earlier the UNGA had declared Goa as a “Non-Self-Governing Territory” under Portuguese administration and India was a signatory to the declaration and did not claim that Goa was Indian Territory till that time. That same year the ICJ acknowledged Portugal’s sovereignty over Dadra and Nagar Aveli, two Portuguese possessions in the Indian sub-continent with the same colonial history as Goa. Therefore India’s first main argument was out. \r\n     Next, the Security Council did not approve use of force by India in Goa. Unfortunately disagreement at the time prevented the UNSC from reaching a decision on the Goa conflict and the ICJ was not asked to arbitrate or provide an advisory opinion. So the second argument was not available.\r\n     Finally, India did not argue self defense to a Portuguese “armed attack”. So by all conventional interpretations, India’s annexation of Goa breached Article 2 of the UN Charter.</p>\r\n     <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n     Illegal Indian claim of acquisition of Goa. Key agreements like the 1907 Porter Convention, the 1920 Covenant of the League of Nations and the 1928 Kellogg–Briand Pact, culminated in Article 2(4) of Chapter I of the UN Charter, which is in force till today: \"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations\". Since the use of force against territorial integrity or political independence is illegal, title or sovereignty cannot be transferred in such a situation. It is generally held that countries are under obligation to abide by the Stimson Doctrine that a state: \"cannot admit the legality of any situation de facto, nor recognize any treaty or agreement entered into between those Governments... not... recognize any situation, treaty or agreement which may be brought about by means contrary to the covenants and obligations of the Pact of Paris of August 27, 1928\". These principles were reconfirmed by the 1970 Friendly Relations Declaration.  </p>\r\n\r\n     <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://un-documents.net/a25r2625.htm\" target=\"_blank\">1970 Friendly Relations Declaration</a> </p>\r\n     <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n    Indian annexation of Goa by India is illegal because annexation is a forcible, violent or unilateral seizure and or incorporation of a territory belonging to a sovereign state into the domain of another sovereign country. Annexation has been strictly rejected and prohibited in terms of American President Woodrow Wilson’s No-Annexation Doctrine soon after WWI. This is why and how Mandate System and Trusteeship System were instituted, in the first place, and formalized in terms of Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant as well as in terms of Articles 75-85 of the Charter, respectively. Moreover during World War II, the use of annexation deprived whole populations of the safeguards provided by international laws governing military occupations. The Fourth Geneva Convention (GCIV) of 1949 amplified the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 with respect to the question of the protection of civilians. The authors of the Fourth Geneva Convention made a point of giving the rules regarding inviolability of rights \"an absolute character\", thus making it much more difficult for a state to bypass international law through the use of annexation. GCIV Article 47, in the first paragraph in Section III: “Occupied territories”, restricted the effects of annexation on the rights of persons within those territories: Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.”</p>\r\n    <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n     India cannot claim conquest over Goa as conquest is also illegal because conquest is the acquisition of sovereignty over a territory by force of arms, exercised by an independent power which reduces the vanquished power to submission of its territory. Conquest does not, per se, give the conquering state plenum dominium et dominium utile (meaning “full ownership” and “equitable ownership”). Moreover, conquest is generally unacceptable as a means for acquiring sovereignty under current norms of international relations.  The acquisition of territory by force of arms (i.e. aggression or similar violation of international law) has, in any event, been illegal in international law since 1945 after the UN Charter came into force. Resolution 1541 (XV) has laid down the principles which the United Nations should follow in respect of territories called colonial. Principle VI mentions only three ways, in which non self-governing territory can be said to have reached a full measure of self-governments, namely:</p>\r\n     <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\na) Emergence as a sovereign independent State</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\nb) Free association with an independent State; or</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\nc) Integration with an independent State.</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n     Obviously, alternatives (a) and (b) are both inapplicable to the case of Goa, as it has neither emerged as an independent State nor has it freely associated with an independent State. Goa’s change of status has been brought about by illegal and criminal force. Only the third alternative remains, therefore, to be considered: integration with an independent State.</p>\r\n     <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n     First of all, no reason can be found why integration with the Indian union should be regarded as of a higher order of values. Resolution 1541 (XV) also specifies the circumstances in which such integration should come about. In this connection Principle IX states:</p>\r\n     <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n(a) The integrating territory should have attained an advanced stage of self-government with free political institutions, so that its people have the capacity to make a responsible choice through informed and democratic processes;</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n(b) The integration should be the result of the freely expressed wishes of the territory’s peoples acting with full knowledge of the change in their status, their wishes having been expressed through informed and democratic progresses, impartially conducted and based on universal adult suffrage. </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n     The United Nations could, when it deems necessary, supervise these processes. These Principles cannot be reconciled with the violent and illegal annexation of Goa, by India. So flagrant is the violation of the UNGA resolutions committed by India that India’s representative who stated in the Security Council – “Charter or no Charter, Council or no Council”, might have also added “Resolutions or no Resolutions”.  India not only violated the Charter and defied the Security Council but infringed on the very anti-colonial resolutions of the General Assembly, which it had itself subscribed to.   </p>\r\n\r\n     <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.ruleoflaw.org.au/the-annexation-of-goa/\" target=\"_blank\">Rule of Law, Institute of Australia</a> </p>\r\n     <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n10.  INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FAVOURED INDIA BY BENDING RULES:  </p> <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\nIndia argued that Portugal had failed its administrative responsibilities to Goa required under UNGA resolution 1514 of 1960. This resolution passed by 90% of the UN members required that “immediate steps” be taken “to transfer all powers” to the people of Non-Self-Governing Territories like Goa.  However, nothing in Resolution 1514 suggested that a failure to comply, meant the administrating power could have a Non-Self-Governing Territory unilaterally seized and absorbed by another country. Indeed UNGA Resolution 1541 states that the integration of a Non-Self-Governing Territory with an existing State “should” come about from the territory freely expressing its wishes democratically.  Portugal had refused to hold a referendum in Goa, but, again, the resolution did not provide for any punishment for this transgression.</p> <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n   What is remarkable about the Goa incident is that the international community, without changing a letter of this law, chose to bend these rules in India’s favour. Not only was Goa being gradually recognised by the community as a legal part of India, but, within 18 months of Goa’s annexation, the UNSC was imposing sanctions on Portugal for continued colonial repression elsewhere in the world, letting India go scot free for its war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights abuses it was committing under its Martial Law in Goa which continued under the so called civilian rule.  Nor was the law changed retrospectively to exonerate India. In 1967 the UNSC noted the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war”, making no apparent distinction between lawful war, unlawful war, and/or war in the pursuit of decolonisation. Ironically this resolution was passed with the help of India, which had gained respect and legitimacy for its defiance of the Charter, to be elected to the Security Council on five separate occasions from 1966 to 1990. Eventually this bending of the rules culminated in 1974 with Portugal itself recognising Goa as a part of India. But what is even more confusing for rule-of-law proponents is that this rule bending did not set a legal precedent.  The General Assembly repeatedly endorsed the right of subjugated peoples to achieve decolonisation “by all available means”, yet no exception has yet been made for the forcible annexation of a Non-Self-Governing Territory by a neighbouring country. \r\n     In 1982, for example, the Security Council rejected Argentina’s attempted annexation of the UK’s Falkland Islands, despite the Goa precedent being discussed and several members accepting Argentina’s argument that the territory belonged to it. Similarly in 1975, the Security Council, whilst noting Portugal’s failure to uphold its administrative responsibilities, unanimously denounced Indonesia’s annexation of East Timor. How can we reconcile this with our understanding of the rule of law? India violated its legal obligations, and yet it suffered no sanctions.</p>\r\n     <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n11.  EXCEPT FOR GOA, MOST PORTUGUESE COLONIES GOT INDEPENDENCE: Almost all Portuguese colonies listed along with Goa as “Non-Self Governing Territories” by the UN like Portuguese Guinea got independence in 1974, Angola, Cape Verde Archipelago, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe in 1975 and East Timor as late as 2002 through the intersession of the UN except Goa. The UN at whose behest all these colonies gained independence mysteriously ignored Goa. Goans now re-colonized by India appeal to the United Nations to end its complacency on the matter of the continued illegal occupation of Goa by India. This petition is not seeking something that is too difficult or impossible, as the UN has previously gone to the extent of allowing multinational force in many similar instances like Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, Eastern Zaire, Albania, Bosnia, Herzegovina, , Bunia in the DRC, Liberia and Kuwait.\r\n</p> \r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/decolonization/nonselfgov.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories (1945-1999)</a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n12.  THE UN ACQUIESCED IN INVASION OF GOA BY INDIA: The UN acquiesced in the matter of the invasion, annexation and illegal occupation of Goa by India for 56 years on the mistaken notion that Goans have wholeheartedly and peacefully accepted the illegal invasion of Goa by India as their liberation, and also that Goa was Indian Territory because the peace loving Goans did not get violent over the Indian invasion and illegal occupation. Perhaps the UN would have acted swiftly if Goans had started a mayhem in Goa, killing and burning people and property in opposing the Indian invasion of their motherland. The UN charter is to have peace in the world, and since the Goans did not retaliate and indulge in violence and mayhem against India, the UN wrongly and conveniently concluded that the objective of peace was attained. Certainly the violence in East Timor, convinced and impressed the UN to give them independence ending 20 years of Indonesian occupation. This means that the UN steps in to enforce the Charter only if there is resistance, brutality, killings and war. The UN seems to have penalized the Goans for displaying civilized non-violent behaviour by denying them independence of their motherland just because they did not violently resist the invasion and illegal occupation of their motherland Goa by India.</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n    Unfortunately, it is difficult to understand what actually motivates and influences the UN, especially the UNSC, to act or to remain silent. One illustration of this point is the case of the civil war that has ravaged Sudan for decades with an estimated two million casualties. And yet the only resolutions passed by the UNSC in relation to Sudan concerned Sudan’s failure to extradite suspects in the attempted assassination of President Mubarak of Egypt, which failure was determined to have threatened international peace and security. If Goans had engaged in violence against the mighty and ruthless India, the entire tiny population of Goa would certainly be massacred to extinction by the Indian might and the UN might have just overlooked it, as it did in Sudan. The UN in this case would have attained “Peace” for India with the elimination of the entire Goan population.  </p>\r\n\r\n    <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://archives.cerium.ca/IMG/pdf/chesterman__2002.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Legality Versus Legitimacy: Humanitarian Intervention, the Security Council, and the Rule of Law</a> </p>\r\n    <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n13.  ONLY VIOLENCE AND MAYHEM GETS THE UN ATTENTION, WHILE ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE IS CONSIDERED PEACE: Goans are peaceful, simple, humble, honest people having trust and faith in law and natural justice. Peaceful Goan people detest unruly behaviour, public disorder, riots, strikes, marches, sloganeering, killings in the streets and burning of property for redressal of grievances and show of opposition. The people of Goa have the culture of reason and debate. They argue and plead for their demands and genuinely believe in due process of law to attain justice. When India invaded and occupied Goa, the Goans did not go about braving the Martial Law and intermittent curfews India imposed on the so called “India’s own liberated people of Goa”, to demonstrate and kill people in the streets opposing the invasion. The Goans looked up to and kept their faith in the UN, the civilized and sensible member nations, and rule of international law. Goans were convinced that it was just a matter of time till the UN stepped in and ended the illegal occupation of Goa by India. Goans who are well educated and well informed in International Law, the Geneva Convention, and the UN Charter, perhaps took it for granted that the temporary Indian aberration and foolish aggressive enterprise would soon be ended by the UN intervention and the mighty force of International Law, and did not find it necessary to get violent. Goans did not want to destroy peace and behave like hooligans following in the Indian example of unruly behaviour. The moment for which Goans patiently waited since 1961 for deliverance by the UN has still not arrived. We Goans have now woken up to the reality that only War, Blood Bath, Killings, Burning, Mayhem and total destruction of peace propels the United Nations into action. It seems that for any aggrieved people to get the UN to act, they must aggressively display violent resistance, like they did in East Timor, and only then the UN will take notice and act. </p> <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n     The United Nations also failed to consider that Goans were muzzled with a ruthless Martial Law and intermittent curfews and intimidation of people who resisted the invasion. The backs of Goans were ruthlessly broken by the then military administration of Goa by committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.  In the bargain, Goans have been subjugated, forced to accept political, economic, social and cultural institutions which are entirely alien to their tradition under Indian colonialism.</p>\r\n     <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n14. GOANS UNFAIRLY SILENCED BY THE UN TRUSTEESHIP COMMITTEE: Goans did not take the path of aggressive resistance to protest the Indian invasion of Goa, but a civilized and decent path through the United Nations. As an example, at a conference on the 3rd December 1963 at Hotel de Palais d’Orsay in Paris, Goans from all over the world met and unanimously resolved to send a four member delegation of Antonio da Fonseca, Wolfgang de Souza, Prof. Leo Anthony de Souza, and Romeo da Silva to the “Trusteeship Committee” of the General Assembly on 10.Dec.63. The Goan delegates were given a hearing before this special committee which hears petitions from oppressed people. But all four Goan delegates were mysteriously silenced by the Committee Chairman, Achkar Marof of Guinea, who, for very curious and suspicious reasons was openly biased towards India and against Goa. He cut their statements short on the grounds that they had been given a hearing solely to express their views exclusively on the Portuguese Non-Self Governing Territories included on the list approved by the United Nation and that Goa was not included in the list. A motion to expunge their testimony from the record was however dropped, as a result of the opposition by the USA, Western members and Liberia. (Reported in The New York Times on 11.Dec.63.) It has come to the attention of Goans from a visiting Goan to the UN that an entry has been made in the UN Year Book that “Goa and its dependencies have been nationally reunited with India.” The petitioners are now incensed having lately confirmed upon checking the records of the UN that indeed the UNGA has struck Goa off the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1962 itself as recorded at page 410 of the UN Year book of 1962. Goa is missing in the list of territories as on 31.Dec.62 at page 408 of the said Year Book. The petitioners have also, to their horror, confirmed that the UN List of Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories (1945-1999) lists Goa and Dependencies as “Change in Status” in 1961.       </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/united-nations/yearbook-of-the-united-nations-1962_04f55469-en#.Wh3Uqf-nEps%23page5#page1\" target=\"_blank\">Yearbook of the United Nations 1962 </a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://wpik.org/colonywestpapua/1962_P1_SEC3_CH1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON TERRITORIES UNDER PORTUGUESE ADMINISTRATION </a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/decolonization/nonselfgov.shtml#p\" target=\"_blank\">Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories (1945-1999)</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1963-pt19/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1963-pt19-5-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Anniversary of a 36 Hour War - Armed Invasion of Goa - Goan Delegation of 4 Silenced by Trusteeship Committee Chairman PAGE 31</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n15. GOANS OBJECT TO THE ENTRY – “GOA REUNITED WITH INDIA”: The UN must resolve to replace the entry in its records which reflects in the Year Books “Goa and its dependencies have been nationally reunited with India.” or any other record,  with an appropriately phrased entry conveying the true and realistic meaning amounting to “Goa and dependencies were illegally invaded and annexed by India without authorization of neither the UNSC nor the UNGA, against the Charter while the territory was on the UN list of Non-Self Governing Territories eligible for independence” As already stated in this petition Goa was never ever a part of India to be reunited with it by illegal invasion and annexation. The said entry is false and seems to be at the behest of India and to favour the aggressor India against all relevant facts favouring Goa’s independence. The people of Goa cannot understand how the UN can be so blinded to ignore the truth and make such notations to benefit India.  </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n16.  APPEAL FOR RETROSPECTIVE ACTION ON ILLEGAL INDIAN OCCUPATION OF GOA. The UN is bound by its Charter to revisit and reconsider the historical illegality of the forceful invasion, annexation and illegal occupation of Goa by its member nation India against the Charter retrospectively and to act in spite of the illegal Treaty between India and Portugal, and the subsequent illegal declaration of Goa as a state of India. India’s previous illegalities against the UN Charter and the world order, including the Geneva Convention, cannot stand legalized nor condoned by subsequent additional illegal acts, as the right to self-determination, plebiscite and independence had already accrued and passed on to the Goans vide the UN resolutions prior to the 19.Dec.61 invasion of Goa. Indo-Portugal treaty is primarily against international law and conventions so established and its intent is to transfer sovereignty over Goa from Portugal to India with retrospective effect at a point of time when Portugal was not vested with any ownership title or sovereignty over Goa. At that point of time Goa was already under the protection of the UN by virtue of being included in the list of “Non-Self Governing Territories” as of 15.Dec.60, eligible for right to self-determination, plebiscite and independence. The Portuguese also seem to be of the same opinion as Dr. Inocencio Galvao Teles, Portugal's principal attorney in the Rights of Passage case against India at the ICJ, who was also Minister for Law in Dr. Oliveira Salazar’s cabinet, in an interview with the journal, O Diabo, of Lisbon on 18.Feb.92 has stated that the Indo Portuguese Treaty of 31.Dec.74 has failed to meet the requirements of International Law and is not valid as it offended the fundamental principles of International Law.</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n17.  GOA REMOVED FROM THE UN LIST IN A HURRY: The UN is bound by its Charter to reconsider the hurried removal of “Goa and dependencies called the State of India” from the UN list of “Non-Self Governing Territories” within a few months of Goa’s invasion by India, with fresh eyes, and the legality of such hurried removal. The Goans are of the opinion that the illegal invasion of Goa by India may have been considered as a ‘fait accompli” by the UN which legally or illegally removed yet another territory from the long and cumbersome list of “Non-Self Governing Territories”. The UNGA has to introspect, do some soul searching and determine whether it is morally and legally justified in its hurry to take territories off the list of Non Self Governing Territories. Goa certainly is an unfortunate victim as elaborated by R.M. Marty M. Natalegawa, Chairman of the Special Committee on Decolonization which, since its establishment in 1961, had monitored the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. “The aim appeared to be the hurried removal of those Territories from the United Nations list, even as they remained Non-Self-Governing. The international community could not countenance such acts, but must decide if it was going to remain true to the relevant provisions of the Charter” With this background, the Goans wonder whether it was just a matter of convenience for the UNGA to hurriedly remove Goa and dependencies from the list by readily agreeing with false Indian claims of liberating its own people of Goa and that Goa was a part of Indian Territory.

RE-INSTATE GOA IN THE UN LIST OF “NON SELF GOVERNING TERRITORIES: The petitioners state that the UN is duty bound under the charter to re-instate Goa in the UN list of “Non-Self Governing Territories” as originally listed in light of the provisions of Chapter and UNGA resolutions. Goans intend to petition the UN (Committee of 24) Special Committee on Decolonization for relief. However they are unable to do so because the said committee, in the matter of the petition signed by 1.80 million West Papuans, has declared that it is not mandated to consider territories not included in the current list of “Non-Self Governing Territories” before it. Since Goa has been unfairly excluded from the said list, the people of Goa are handicapped in petitioning the said Special Committee and hence prayerfully petition all the member nations of the UNGA to rightfully re-instate Goa in the said list. </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n19.  INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE ON GOA: The United Nations must consider or re-evaluate the rulings and advisory opinions of the ICJ already on its record and more particularly its judgement of 1960, delivered in the matter of the “Right of Passage Case”, in which it ruled that India had no right of claim on the enclaves of Dadra and Nagar Aveli, parts of the district of Damão, with the same colonial history as Goa and that Portugal has sovereignty over these enclaves, or seek a fresh ruling or advisory opinion from the ICJ on the illegal invasion and annexation of Goa by India in terms of established international law and conventions as stated in the aforesaid Para 9 of this petition.      </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/32/4523.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> ICJ JUDGMENT OF 12 APRIL 1960 </a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/32/032-19600412-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">  ICJ CASE CONCERNING RIGHT OF PASSAGE OVER: INDIAN TERRITORY</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n 20.  GOA NEVER DEPENDED ON INDIA’S PATRONAGE: Before the Indian invasion, Goa was economically far ahead of the Indian Union and never depended on India’s patronage, and on the contrary, had prospered in every way. Goa was well settled, developed and through the centuries became un-debatably prosperous in the Indian subcontinent. This prosperity never escaped the eye of the world press, which had to connect it with India’s intentions to annex it. The few examples from the world press are as follows:</p>\r\n <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n \"Der Spiegel\" a well-known German political news magazine, issued an article on 10th January 1962: \"Behind the violent occupation of Goa by India stands the economic interest as Goa's export of iron will yearly add 250 million DM into the Indian Treasury to build up its money reserves from only 982 Million Rupees (825 million DM).\" </p>\r\n <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" of 5th December, 1961, reported: \"Goa earns more than 10 Million pounds a year at present from her mining operations by exporting mostly to Japan and West Germany. This incidentally is a good reason for grabbing the colony so far as hard-currency hungry India is concerned.\"</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\nIndian rule has wrecked Goa’s economy and ended its prosperity, impoverished it with mounting accumulated debts and interest on loans. Goa’s current total accumulated debt is almost Rs.70,000 Crores and the 2015-16 government loan interest liabilities stood at 1,846 Crores. None of the loans have ever been repaid as there is no money to repay borrowings. Most loans finance construction projects like roads and bridges which are a good source of kickbacks to the political class from overpriced projects with substandard quality as bridges and roads in Goa do not last very long. Newly constructed roads mostly get washed out with the slightest hint of a monsoon rain shower. With the inevitable failure of the Tourism and Mining Industries the main income and employment generators for Goans, Goa is on the verge of State Bankruptcy. </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n 21.  GOA UNFAIRLY SUSTAINS THE INDIAN ECONOMY TO A SUBSTANTIAL EXTENT: Goa’s current annual budget is about Rs.15,000 Crores while the total revenue of the Indian Union in terms of Federal Taxes collected from Goa is almost double of Goa’s annual budget. According to an Indian formula (formerly Gadgil Formula) of sharing this revenue with Goa, based on population, per capita income, area, infrastructure, tax effort, fiscal discipline and literacy Goa gets classified as a rich state. It gets classified as such, because Goa has a smaller population, higher per capita income (mainly earnings by Goans employed overseas,) smaller area, fairly good infrastructure, honesty in tax payment by honest Goans and highest literacy rate as compared to most Indian states. As per this formula Goa’s total share of Union Taxes and grants was 2,459 Crores or 16% for 2005-2010, as compared to 90% to the Indian state of Manipur, 56% to Uttarakhand and 53% to UP. Goa contributes a greater percentage to the National GDP of India than its share from the pool of central taxes that are redistributed. Goa’s mineral wealth of iron and manganese ore has been depleted by illegal mining by giving mining concessions to a select few industrialists in a corrupt environment without any benefit to the Goans who are actually the owners of this mineral wealth. The only beneficiaries of this over exploited environmental hazard have been India, the mining companies and the politicians, one of whom is Digambar Kamat, a former BJP Minister for Mines and later a Congress Chief Minister cum mines Minister. He, presently as a Congress MLA, is being prosecuted by the ruling BJP government due to his indictment by the ‘Shah Commission which investigated illegal mining in Goa. Digambar Kamath’s alleged illegalities cost Goa Rs. 35,000 Crores. If recovered, this amount count have paid off half of Goa’s public debt of Rs. 70,000 Crores, but in a perfect Indian style ‘Match Fixing” Goans know that he will inevitably be acquitted of all charges when he rejoins his parent party, the BJP, with the Rs. 35,000 Crores of illegal mining booty forgotten and/or condoned. On the other hand If the Indian union had only matched Goa’s budget of 15000 Crores under a Special Status for an illegally occupied territory, Goa could have a Tax Free Economy, infrastructure could be developed to international standards and Goans could even get dividends and pension benefits paid to them by the state from the excess of state revenue over expenditure. On the contrary Goa is unfairly and unjustly sustaining the Indian economy to a substantial extent as income extracted from Goans is being spent to develop Indian states like UP and Uttarakhand while Goa is burdened with a debt of Rs. 70,000 Crores. The Goan politicians have no objection to this unfairness as most governments in Goa belong to Indian national political parties like BJP and Congress. They do not want to upset the Indian Government in the interest of their own political comfort at the cost of the Goan economy and welfare of the Goan people. Unfortunately under the Indian illegal occupation, the indigenous Goans do not get a chance in managing their own destinies.             </p>\r\n\r\n <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://adrindia.org/sites/default/files/Analysis_of_State_Budget_Allocation_of_Goa_Manipur_Punjab_Uttar_Pradesh_and_Uttarakhand_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Analysis of State Budget Allocation of Goa</a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.goachamber.org/wp-content/uploads/GoaEconomicSurvey2016-17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Goa Economic Survey 2016-17 </a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://fincomindia.nic.in/writereaddata%5Chtml_en_files%5Cfincom14/others/6.pdfEconomic%C2%A0\" target=\"_blank\"> Finance Commission of India  </a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Give-Goa-a-higher-share-in-central-taxes/articleshow/29519700.cms\" target=\"_blank\"> 'Give Goa a higher share in central taxes' </a> </p>\r\n <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n22.  BROKEN PROMISES OF GRANTING SPECIAL STATUS: Goans are now frustrated with the broken promises made to them by national and political leaders of India. Since 1961 the people of Goa have been repeatedly promised that the unique identity of Goa will be preserved and a ‘Special Status would be given by amending Article 371 of the Indian constitution. These promises have been made repeatedly by India’s first Prime Minister Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru to the current Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi and everyone in between. In 2007, as the President of the Congress Party, Mrs. Sonia Gandhi promised ‘Special Status’ for Goa in a public ‘election’ speech at Campal, Panjim, which was promptly forgotten after the elections. The current PM in a public election speech in Goa in Jan. 2014 (video link below) declared that the demand for Special Status for Goa is genuine and reasonable and promised that he will grant it once elected PM. But once he became PM he had the audacity to declare that Goa does not qualify for the Special Status. The State Legislature of Goa on 15.Apr.13 unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Indian government to grant a ‘Special Status’ to Goa under Article 371 of the Indian Constitution.. The Goa Chief Minister Mr. Manohar Parrikar, on this day, stated in the House, that out of Goa’s total 3,702 sq kms of land, only 362 sq kms were left for the future development, which he said was a cause for concern. He stated \"Goa is only demanding Special Status to preserve its land mass and cultural identity,\" adding that it should be granted on lines of the Indian states of Mizoram and Uttarakhand. Presenting a case for Special Status before the House, the Chief Minister said that Goans will lose their identity due to unprecedented inward migration from Indian States. Mr. Parrikar is a Goan strongman of the BJP and the most favourite Goan friend of the PM Modi who was even rewarded by the PM with the post of Defence MInister of India. Unfortunately he does not get for Goa what he boldly talks about in the Goa Assembly.      </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irWW28k8lJc\" target=\"_blank\"> Modi on Goa Special Status </a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/goa-assembly-passes-resolution-seeking-special-status-21958.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Goa assembly passes resolution seeking special status</a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.indiaspend.com/investigations/indias-10-most-indebted-states-85927\" target=\"_blank\">  India’s 10 Most Indebted States</a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n23.  INDIAN CONSTITUTION CONTRARY TO GOAN INTERESTS: To the utter disappointment of Goan aspirations, the Indian Union Minister Kiren Rijiju stated in parliament that Goa's demand for ‘Special Status’ under article 371 of the Constitution is not justifiable and hence not agreed to since it contravenes article 19(1)(d) and 19(1)(e) of the Indian Constitution. Article 19(1)(d) gives Indian citizens the right \"to move freely throughout the territory of India\" while article 19(1)(e) accords the right \"to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India\". The fundamental disagreement Goans have with India is that Goa is not, and has never ever been a territory of India and is an illegally occupied territory. Therefore Article 19(1)(e) must not apply to Goa especially in terms of the Geneva Convention which mandates that “in and out” flow of population has to be controlled in an occupied territory. The provisions of the Indian constitution are contrary to Goa’s interests. We Goans did not invite India to invade, illegally occupy and force Indian Constitution on Goa. India not only forced itself, its constitution and it’s citizenship on us, but is not willing to make any promised amendments to its constitution to protect Goa’s unique identity and interests. Goa being an illegally occupied territory cannot be treated on par with other Indian states to allow Indians to freely buy land, settle in Goa or to add to the illegal vote banks living in illegal shanties and slums for the Indian political class to outnumber the Goan voters and devastate Goa further.  India needed to treat Goa differently like the Indian states of Mizoram and Uttarakhand. This by itself justifies the demand for Goa’s Independence from India. The people of Goa can no longer trust the Indian Union to honour any of its promises nor to prevent their motherland and their unique identity evolved over centuries from getting demographically diluted under the illegal Indian occupation. </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Centre-rejects-Goas-special-status-demand/articleshow/39317302.cms\" target=\"_blank\"> Centre rejects Goa's special status demand </a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n24.  STATE LEGISLATURE ENACTING LAWS ULTRA VIRES THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION: As an example of the Indian lawlessness, the Goa Daman and Diu (Administration) Act 1962, passed by the Indian Parliament after annexation of Goa by India provides that all existing laws in Goa as on 20.12.1961 shall remain in force unless amended by the Indian Parliament within two years. None of the laws have been amended nor repealed by India. The Uniform Civil Code and the Code of Comunidades are two of Goa’s ancient laws which are in force. Under the Indian electoral system, illiterate, semi-literate and uneducated persons who have absolutely no legal sense are eligible to contest elections and become legislators and parliamentarians. As a result most of the so called legislators in the Goa Legislative Assembly have no clue about legislating and tend to pass laws that are illegal by force of majority in the house. Law in Goa has not been clear since 1962 and the legislators and parliamentarians who are responsible to clear the lacuna are not aware of the problem and do not have the mental faculties to understand the subject. As per legal interpretation of the Indian law applied to Goa Vis a Vis the Goa Daman and Diu (Administration) Act 1962 the Indian “Revenue District” system is illegal in Goa as the Code of Comunidades under which most land in Goa belongs to Village Comunidades, does not recognize the Indian Revenue Districts. As a consequence, the local self-governments like the Panchayats, Municipalities including the Collectorates and the full revenue system based on the Indian administrative model is illegal in Goa. The Goa State Legislature without any locus standi under the central act keeps passing amendments to local laws like the Code of Comunidades, which are primarily ultra vires of the Constitution of India. Most of the amendments passed are to take over and dole out community and agricultural land for political gains at a pittance. This is just one example of how under the Indian rule illegal legislations are passed by the state legislature which are ultra vires the country’s constitution. Very often the Judicial Courts in Goa tend to deliver faulty judgements by not considering Goa’s local law because the Indian Judges posted in Goan courts are not aware of the existence of Goa’s unique laws. Goans have to repeatedly approach High Courts and even the Supreme Court of India in Delhi seeking proper interpretations and judgements over the faulty orders of the lower courts and are frustrated by the slow moving legal system, the decades that it takes to get a judgement and the tremendous amount of money and resources that it takes. The Indian electoral system elects illiterate and uneducated street smart opportunists to its legislature and successive governments whose only aim is to shamelessly enrich themselves by scamming the exchequer in any possible way. While criminals and law breakers are usually sent to jail, the Indian electoral system sends them to state legislatures and parliament as law makers. As of now 34% of the current Indian parliamentarians have criminal cases against them and the present ruling party BJP tops the list as per newspaper accounts. The State of Goa under Indian rule and its functionaries have allowed ingress of systemic anarchy, throwing propriety to the winds possibly harbouring the attitude of utter indifference and nurturing an incurable propensity to pave the path of deviancy.        </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.theindianlawyer.in/statutesnbareacts/acts/g8.html#_Toc39313682\" target=\"_blank\"> THE GOA, DAMAN AND DIU (ADMINISTRATION) ACT, 1962  </a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/uk-parliament-debates-massive-corruption-in-goa/story-aWi6mKtx926Gtl2lDL9yRM.html\" target=\"_blank\"> UK parliament debates massive corruption in Goa  </a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/16th-lok-sabha-will-be-richest-have-most-mps-with-criminal-charges/article6022513.ece\" target=\"_blank\"> One-third of new MPs face criminal charges   </a> </p>\r\n\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-has-highest-no-of-mps-and-mlas-with-cases-of-crime-against-women-study/story-UKFaWnMeVYCXCED03AZdGP.html\" target=\"_blank\"> BJP has highest no. of MPs, MLAs with cases of crime against women: ADR study</a> </p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\nPRAYER TO THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY.</p>\r\n<p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n The petitioners pray that the UN General Assembly resolve to, and re-instate Goa in the UN list of “Non-Self Governing Territories” as originally listed on 15.Dec.60 in light of the provisions of the UN Charter and UNGA resolutions and more particularly UNGA resolution 742 (VIII) and principles approved in resolution 1542 (XV).</p>\r\n <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n Goa might not have attained sovereignty but that right does not lapse, a right that cannot be assumed by others, a right which is inherent to people.

He invited some people to his ship and managed to trade. He was told by a Tunisian Muslim there to meet with the ruler of Calicut, the Zamorin. So he sent a couple of his men to meet him. The ruler told them that in order to trade, they would have to make the necessary payments and obtain a letter of concession. He managed to secure it though he had to leave some of his men with the ruler as security for the payment. This enraged Vasco and led him to take quite a number of natives in return. \r\n\r\n            It can be safe to say that Gama's trip to India was a good venture, he was able to bring in cargo worth 60 times the cost of the journey.\r\n            \r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <MDBRow >\r\n  \r\n  <MDBCol id=\"\" size=\"12\" md=\"6\">   <MDBView   className=\"z-depth-5\" hover>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBRow>\r\n  \r\n  <figure className=\"figure\">\r\n      <img src=\"https://exploration.marinersmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2014/02/Vasco-da-Gama.png\" className=\"figure-img img-fluid z-depth-1\"\r\n        alt=\"\" style={{width: '1200px'}} />\r\n      <figcaption className=\"figure-caption\">\r\n\r\n      \r\n    Dom Vasco da Gama\r\n\r\n      </figcaption>\r\n\r\n    </figure>\r\n  \r\n           </MDBRow>\r\n  </MDBView></MDBCol>\r\n  <MDBCol id=\"\" size=\"12\" md=\"6\">   <MDBView   className=\"z-depth-5\" hover>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBRow>\r\n  \r\n  <figure className=\"figure\">\r\n      <img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UT_RkFlILm8/Vl9l4lfZNCI/AAAAAAAAAUM/-FuuuaWk01g/s1600/d9cfdae30387977d15708a506366a3db.jpg\" className=\"figure-img img-fluid z-depth-1\"\r\n        alt=\"\" style={{width: '1200px'}} />\r\n      <figcaption className=\"figure-caption\">\r\n\r\n      \r\n      Pedro Álvares Cabral\r\n      </figcaption>\r\n \r\n    </figure>\r\n  \r\n           </MDBRow>\r\n  </MDBView></MDBCol>\r\n  \r\n  </MDBRow>\r\n            \r\n      \r\n  \r\n            <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox id = \"The first arrival of the Portuguese: Pedro Álvares Cabral\" tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>Pedro Álvares Cabral</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n\r\nPedro Cabral was an important figure who sailed to India to trade for pepper and other spices, he was able to negotiate for and establish a factory in Calicut. He arrived in 13 September 1500. He faced some hardship when his factory at Kozhikode was surprisingly attacked by locals, which led to the death of more than 50 Portuguese men. As a result, Cabral was angered by the incident caused Cabral to take control of 10 Arab merchanyt ships which were docked at the harbour. He killed about 600 of their crew and annexed their cargo before burning the ships. Calicut also had his ships bombard Calicut for an entire day as a consequence for violating the agreement. However,Cabral was able to secure treaties with the local rulers at Cochin and Cannanore. Cabral started to return back to Portugal from 16 Jan 1501 and was able to reach there on 23 June 1501, unfortunately with only 4 of the 13 ships.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese were able to build the Pulicat fort in 1502, with the aid of the Vijaynagar ruler.\r\n\r\nVasco da Gama was able to sail to India the second time with 15 ships and 800 men. This was after his first unfortunate encounter with the Muslims in Calicut, so this time he arrived on 30 October 1502. The ruler in Calicut was willing to sign a treaty this time instead of retaliating with ire. Gama requested that all Muslims (Arab) be thrown out from Calicut, however this request was denied. Gama was able to bombard the city and capture several rice vessels. He returned to Portugal in September 1503.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<MDBRow>\r\n            <MDBCol   size=\"12\"  md=\"4\"><MDBCol>\r\n            <figure className=\"figure\">\r\n      <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Retrato_de_D._Francisco_de_Almeida_%28ap%C3%B3s_1545%29_-_Autor_desconhecido.png/330px-Retrato_de_D._Francisco_de_Almeida_%28ap%C3%B3s_1545%29_-_Autor_desconhecido.png\" className=\"figure-img img-fluid z-depth-1\"\r\n        alt=\"\" style={{width: '1200px'}} />\r\n      <figcaption className=\"figure-caption\">\r\n\r\n      \r\n    Dom Francisco de Almeida\r\n      </figcaption>\r\n\r\n    </figure>\r\n            </MDBCol></MDBCol>\r\n  \r\n            <MDBCol   size=\"12\"  md=\"6\"><MDBCol>\r\n              <MDBView hover zoom>\r\n                <img\r\n                  src=\"https://www.keralatourism.org/images/destination/mobile/st_angelo_fort_kannur20131031115739_83_1.jpg\"\r\n            \r\n                  alt=\"\"\r\n                />\r\n                <MDBMask className=\"flex-center\" overlay=\"green-strong\">\r\n                  <p className=\"white-text\">Fort St. Angelo, Cannanore</p>\r\n                </MDBMask>\r\n               \r\n           \r\n              </MDBView>\r\n\r\n              <MDBView hover zoom>\r\n                <img\r\n                  src=\"https://i2.wp.com/itsgoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Andj-Fort-EDIT.jpg?fit=595%2C371&ssl=1\"\r\n            \r\n                  alt=\"\"\r\n                />\r\n                <MDBMask className=\"flex-center\" overlay=\"green-strong\">\r\n                  <p className=\"white-text\">Fort Anjediva, Anjediva Island</p>\r\n                </MDBMask>\r\n               \r\n           \r\n              </MDBView>\r\n            </MDBCol></MDBCol> </MDBRow>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox id = \"The first arrival of the Portuguese: Dom Francisco de Almeida\" tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>Dom Francisco de Almeida</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n  \r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\"> Francisco was elected as the Viceroy of India, provided that he set up four forts \r\n  on the southwestern Indian coast, namely at Anjediva Island, Cannanore, Cochin and Quilon. He departed from Portugal with a fleet of 22 vessels with 1,500 men.\r\n\r\n  Almeida reached Anjediva Island where he started building Fort Anjediva post haste. On 23 October, he started building Fort St. Angelo at Cannanore. He left Lourenço de Brito with 150 men and two ships to take charge of the fort.\r\n\r\n  Almeida reached Cochin on 31st October 1505 with just 8 vessels remaining. It was there that he learned that his traders at Quilon were killed. So, he sent his son Lourenço  with 6 ships. They were able to destroy 27 Calicut vessels in the harbour of Quilon. Almeida stayed in Cochin where he was able to strengthen the Portuguese fort of Manuel.\r\n\r\nThe Muslim ruler there (the Zamorin) mustered a fleet of 200 ships to do battle with the Portuguese. However Almeida's son Lourenço was victorious in a battle at sea at the entrance to the harbour of Cannanore. This was the battle of Cannanore. This was also an important setback to the fleet of the Zamorin. Lourenço decided to explore the area south below India, which is the coastal area of Colombo, which is now in Sri Lanka. Trouble struck the Portuguese fortification when a new ruler, opposed to the Portuguese and allied to the Zamorin, attacked the said garrison. This was the siege of Cannanore.\r\n\r\n\r\n<MDBRow >\r\n  \r\n  <MDBCol id=\"\" size=\"12\" md=\"6\">   <MDBView   className=\"z-depth-5\" hover>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBRow>\r\n  \r\n  <figure className=\"figure\">\r\n      <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Tristano_da_Acugna_%28Giovio_Series%29.jpg\" className=\"figure-img img-fluid z-depth-1\"\r\n        alt=\"\" style={{width: '1200px'}} />\r\n      <figcaption className=\"figure-caption\">\r\n\r\n      \r\n      Tristão da Cunha\r\n\r\n      </figcaption>\r\n\r\n    </figure>\r\n  \r\n           </MDBRow>\r\n  </MDBView></MDBCol>\r\n  <MDBCol id=\"\" size=\"12\" md=\"6\">   <MDBView   className=\"z-depth-5\" hover>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBRow>\r\n  \r\n  <figure className=\"figure\">\r\n      <img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VfMvekEu2UY/V71XTAXynbI/AAAAAAAAkNQ/BNGyUdQuAxAo0WRhgUJvhc3ILEQO5nFpACLcB/s1600/Albuquerque_sq.png\" className=\"figure-img img-fluid z-depth-1\"\r\n        alt=\"\" style={{width: '1200px'}} />\r\n      <figcaption className=\"figure-caption\">\r\n\r\n      \r\n      Afonso de Albuquerque\r\n      </figcaption>\r\n \r\n    </figure>\r\n  \r\n           </MDBRow>\r\n  </MDBView></MDBCol>\r\n  \r\n  </MDBRow>\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\nAlmeida's mission was further fortified by the coming of Tristão da Cunha's squadron.

A new fleet led by Marshal Fernão Coutinho reached with orders to destroy the power of the Zamorin in Calicut. The result was thte Zamorin's palace was captured, destroyed and the city was set ablaze. Unfortunately, in retaliation the forces of the Muslim king reunited and killed Coutinho and wounded Albuquerque. He decided to change his mind and establish a treaty with the Zamorin in 1513 to protect the Portuguese interests in Malabar. It wasn't long before beligerence erupted when an attempt was made by the Portuguese to assassinate the Zamorin sometime around 1515 and 1518. However, in 1510, Albuquerque together with the allied help of the Hindu Vijayanagar empire were able to defeat the Bijapur sultan leading to the formation of a permanent holding in Old Goa (Goa Velha). The Southern region, known as Goa, became the headquarters of Portuguese India. This was also the seat of the Portuguese viceroy who controlled the Portuguese possessions in Asia.\r\n  \r\n  The Portuguese managed to set up colonies in and around Mylapore. A key feature of their rule was to demolish Hindu temples and establish Catholic churches and spread Christianity to the heathens of the region. They built the Luz church in Mylapore, Madras (modern day Chennai), which was the first church built by them in 1516. In 1522, the São Tomé church was built in the place of the Kapaleeshwarar temple, which they looted and destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese were able to acquire territories from the Sultans of Gujarat namely Damaon, Salsette, Bombay, Baçaim (Bassein), and Diu.\r\n\r\nIn 1526, the Portuguese took control of Mangalore, under the viceroyship of Lop Vaz de Sampaio. This territory included parts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi in Karnataka state, and Kasaragod in Kerala state (South Canara). Mangalore called as the islands of O Padrão de Santa Maria; later came to be known as St. Mary's Islands. The Keladi Nayaka Kingdom were able to defeat the Portuguese in 1640. The Portuguese political power in the Kanara region was destroyed by one Shvappa Nayaka, which resulted in the capturing of all the Portuguese forts of the coastal region.\r\n\r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title' id = \"The Inquisition\">The Inquisition</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there were bad sides to the Portuguese rule, even though the rules were changed in the future under their rule. In 1546, the Portuguese rule sadly included the inquisition. Jesuit Missionary Francis Xavier set up the Goa Inquisition for the \"new Christians\" in a letter dated 16 May 1546 to King John III of Portugal. Various communities such as the Hindus, Muslims and Bene Israelis were publically persecuted by the Portuguese and the Padroado Jesuit clergy, even before the Inquisition was set up. It is important to note here that the inquisition was not limited to Goa or even India, but also included Europe where Protestants were mostly targeted. There were new Christians and Eastern Christians who were frequently wrongly accused of \"Crypto-Hinduism\" and \"Judaising\". They were the main targets of the persecution and punishment for their faith by the Padroado Jesuit prosecutors.\r\n\r\n<MDBRow >\r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n  <figure className=\"figure\">\r\n      <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Map_of_Portuguese_India.png\" className=\"figure-img img-fluid z-depth-1\"\r\n        alt=\"\" style={{width: '1200px'}} />\r\n      <figcaption className=\"figure-caption\">\r\n\r\n      \r\n      Map of India with Sri Lanka, illustrating locations of European settlements in the subcontinent between 1501 and 1739.\r\n\r\n      </figcaption>\r\n    \r\n    </figure>\r\n  \r\n          \r\n  \r\n  </MDBRow>\r\n\r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title' id = \"Later Events during Portuguese occupancy\">Later Events during Portuguese occupancy</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n\r\nBombay (Mumbai) as a dowry to Charles II of England by his wife Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza in 1661. The Maratha Confederacy in 1739 was able to take over much of the Northern Province when they attacked and robbed Fort Bassein in the Battle of Bassein. Portugal acquired Dadra and Nagar Haveli in 1779.\r\n\r\nDue to the friendly relationship between the Portuguese and British, Goa was briefly occupied by the British from 1799 to 1813.\r\n\r\nThe capital of Goa was shifted to Panjim, which at that time (1843) was known as Nova (new) Goa. This was when it became the administrative seat of Portuguese India. The erstwhile seat and capital was Velha Goa (Old Goa), even though the viceroys lived there since 1 December 1759. \r\n\r\nÓrfãs d'El-Rei was a term used to refer to Portuguese girl orphans. The term translates into \"Orphans of the King\". They were sent to overseas colonies to marry either Portuguese settlers or the natives which possessed high status.\r\n\r\nHence, as a result the footprint of the Portuguese spreads vastly to various parts of the world, however Goa became the capital of Portuguese Goa from 1530 all the way until the time when the Indians took over Goa and its eventual merge with India in 1961.\r\n</p>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title' id = \"The final unfortunate ending - 1947 - 1961\">The final unfortunate ending - 1947 - 1961</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n  \r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\">Nearing the annexation of Goa, Portugal had gone under dictatorship rule by Dr. Salazar, Hence it was a time when views were suppressed. This didn't bode too well for Goa as the number of revolts and mutinous assemblies increased. There was probably more civil unrest amongst the Hindus as compared to Catholics as Catholics had better standings in Portuguese society.\r\n  \r\n  On 24 July 1954 an organisation called \"The United Front of Goans\" seized the enclave of Dadra. The remaining territory of Nagar Haveli was taken over by the Azad Gomantak Dal on 2 August 1954. The conclusion at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, regarding access to Dadra and Nagar Haveli was a stalemate. \r\n  \r\n  From 1954, the Satyagrahis (who peaceful protesters engaged in civil disobedience) against Portuguese rule, outside Goa and Damaon's borders were violently restrained through coercive force. This resulted in tensions between the newly created India and Portuguese Goa resulting in the Indian consulate's closure in Panjim and the representation of Portuguese Goa in India to seize its presence. India also imposed an official ban or trade and other commercial activity (economic embargo) against the territories of Portuguese Goa. The Indian Government  decided to rather wait and watch what would happen next from 1955 to 1961 with many representations to the Portuguese Salazar dictatorship, and made attempts to emphasize the importance of decolonisation before the international community.\r\n\r\nThe TAIP (Transportes Aéreos da Índia Portuguesa) was set up to ensure that transportation of people and goods to and from the Indian enclaves could be carried out by the Salazar dictatorship.\r\n\r\nPortuguese rule came to an abrupt end in December 1961 unfortunately when India took the extreme step and used military action to drive the Portuguese to surrender. Such an action was extremely unfair to the people of Goa as it did not include a referendum as to whether they would want to continue being under Portuguese rule or not. This created mixed feelings from other countries in the world. Such an action also included forcefully making Indian citizens of Goans who were rightfully Portuguese. Hence this caused the Portuguese government to graciously open up a way which would benefit many Goans even today, in that they would be granted Portuguese citizenship after a thorough check on the ancestry of Goans to ensure that their relatives existed during Portuguese rule.\r\n\r\nThe military action was extremely unfair to the Portuguese who had only about 3,300 men stationed in Goa, while the Indian soldiers numbered to about 30,000 people with full air and naval support. The Governor General of Portuguese India officially surrendered on 19 December 1961.\r\n</p>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBRow >\r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n  <figure className=\"figure\">\r\n      <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/European_settlements_in_India_1501-1739.png\" className=\"figure-img img-fluid z-depth-1\"\r\n        alt=\"\" style={{width: '1200px'}} />\r\n      <figcaption className=\"figure-caption\">\r\n\r\n      \r\n      Map of India with Sri Lanka, illustrating locations of European settlements in the subcontinent between 1501 and 1739.\r\n\r\n      </figcaption>\r\n    \r\n    </figure>\r\n  \r\n          \r\n  \r\n  </MDBRow>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBRow >\r\n  \r\n  <MDBCol id=\"References\" size=\"12\" md=\"12\">   <MDBView   className=\"z-depth-5\" hover>\r\n  \r\n  <ParallaxBanner  id=\"vu\"\r\n  className=\"your-class\"\r\n  layers={[\r\n  {\r\n  image: 'https://www.anratechnologies.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/history.jpg',\r\n  amount: 0.5,\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n  image: 'https://www.anratechnologies.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/history.jpg',\r\n  amount: 0.2,\r\n  },\r\n  ]}\r\n  style={{\r\n  height: '500px',\r\n  }}\r\n  >\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  </ParallaxBanner> \r\n  </MDBView></MDBCol>\r\n  \r\n  </MDBRow>\r\n  \r\n             </MDBCol>\r\n              \r\n             \r\n            </MDBRow>\r\n    \r\n            <MDBCol size=\"12\" md=\"12\">  \r\n  <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='warning'>\r\n  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} id = \"references\" className='bq-title'>References:</MDBBox> </MDBTypography>\r\n  <p></p>\r\n  </MDBCol>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBRow>\r\n  <MDBCol > <MDBTypography note noteColor='warning'>  <MDBTypography blockquote className=\"text-left\">\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_India\" target=\"_blank\">Portuguese India</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governors_of_Portuguese_India\" target=\"_blank\">List of governors of Portuguese India</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_India_Armadas\" target=\"_blank\">Portuguese India Armadas</a></li>\r\n    \r\n  </ul>  </MDBTypography></MDBTypography></MDBCol></MDBRow>\r\n  \r\n  </MDBContainer> \r\n  );\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  export default gridExamplesPage;","D:\\Udemy courses\\HTML5, CSS3, Jquery, Javascript\\Projects\\React project website\\goa-porto-1\\src\\components\\AboutMe.js",["357","358"],"import React from 'react'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimport './AboutMe.css';\r\n\r\nimport Footer from './Footer';\r\n\r\nimport { MDBListGroup, MDBListGroupItem, MDBContainer } from \"mdbreact\";\r\nimport { MDBTypography, MDBBox } from \"mdbreact\";\r\nimport { MDBRow, MDBCol } from \"mdbreact\";\r\n\r\nconst AboutMe = () => {\r\n    return ( <>\r\n        <MDBContainer id=\"\">\r\n          <MDBRow>\r\n            <MDBCol  md=\"8\" id=\"title\"> <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='success'>\r\n            <MDBBox  tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>Who am I?

Christopher Colombus was supposed to reach India but unfortunately yet at the same time fortunately discovered a sea route to America from Europe. This discovery by Vaso and other Portuguese explorers made a huge influence on the history of Goa as can be seen with the many attractions which exist in Goa today.  They established a profitable spice trade and decided to make Goa as their centre.

A good example is that of fort Aguada, which helped to defend Goa from the Dutch and the Marathas. It had a built in freshwater spring which provided water to ships which would stop by the fort. This spring had a capacity of storing about 2300000 gallons of water which resulted in becoming the largest freshwater storage not just in India but also for Asia. Now, it still stands strong though it serves for the purposes of tourism along with other forts build by the Portuguese in Goa.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox id = \"Legacy of the Portuguese - The benefits obtained: Education, Scools, Religion, Festivals, Architecture, Food\" tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>Education, Scools, Religion, Festivals, Architecture, Food</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese also helped with bringing about a legacy of rich education by establishing Roman Catholic schools. They helped with the spread of Christianity and as a result many Hindus and Muslims were asked to convert themselves into Catholics. As a result, Goa has a strong Catholic background even though the number of Hindus far exceeds those of Roman Catholics today. Various festivals such as Easter, Carnival and Christmas are celebrated, which have European origin. The Portuguese also had a great influence in the design of local architecture which is still evident today, as well as on food habits and diet.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox id = \"Conclusion\" tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>Conclusion</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n\r\n  We cannot get away from the amount of influence that Portugal has left on Goa. Even in the Goan's local language of Konkani, you can find their influence in the form of many Portuguese words being used in Konkani.</p>\r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n  The people in Goa are also considered to be more complicated and liberal in terms of their manners and opinions, which is quite different from the rest of India. Goan scholars were also influenced by European philosophy which changed their complete thinking on life.</p>\r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n Portuguese culture influenced various fields such as art, architecture,culture, food, ethnicity, music and literature etc. Even today we can notice Portuguese elements in Goan churches and convents such such as the huge structures, dome-shaped windwos, arches, tilted roofs and verandahs.</p>\r\n <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n Also, there are European style bungalows which have wrought-iron balconies and inner courtyards. Concerning colours, only churches and chapels were allowed to be painted white, being the colour of purity and sanctity. Private houses didn't have this priviledge.. Both Hindus and Christians followed this rule.</p>\r\n <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\nThe impact of western education cannot be overlooked on Goans. They were able to understand the scientific features of Latin. The first printing press was brought in India by the Portuguese. It helped with the migration of Goans to other places in the world because there could be cultural exchanges across countries.</p>\r\n<p className=\"historytext\">\r\nEating habits were not immune. Goans started to eat beef and pork as an important part of their meals. People started to wear European clothes. There were also codes which were compulsorily enforced to ensure gender discrimination was reduced. Goans were able to learn to play western musical instruments as well as take up musical careers professionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='primary'>  <MDBBox id = \"Legacy in other parts of Asia\" tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>Legacy in other parts of Asia</MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n  <p  className=\"historytext\">\r\n\r\nAccording to Howard J. Wiarda, the Woodrow Wilson Center Senior Scholar, he says that concerning Macao, the presence of the Portuguese was strong and long, though the city has been handed over to the Chinese. He also mentioned that 450 years of Portuguese presence led to a legacy of churches, schools with also an effect on public administration, polical culture, labor relations, civil service laws and the court system. However, Portuguese influence has been fading, though there has been effort to promote Portuguese and maintain its position in civil society.\r\n\r\nBringing up the topic of Goa again, we notice that he mentioned that the Portuguese empire used Goa as its Asian headquarters and administrative center; hence this caused the Portuguese culture to penetrate deeply into society. The Portuguese methods also had a deep impact on public administration, women’s rights, divorce law and political culture. He mentioned that in Goa, Portugal had an important task to preserve the rich archive of the Viceroy’s administrative papers, which is however currently neglected and falling apart. Portugal has been keen to help with the restoration of churches that are in regular use.\r\n\r\nThe legacy of the Portuguese remains strongly in East Timor, even though the Portuguese were accused of avandoning the former colony in 1975 when they had problems with the Indonesians. Portuguese is still one of the official languages of East Timor. Their constitution is virtually a copy of Portugal's. Portugal has also been a giver of aid on a large scale inspite of not being a rich country.\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n    \r\n            <MDBCol size=\"12\" md=\"12\">  \r\n  <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='warning'>\r\n  <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} id = \"references\" className='bq-title'>References:</MDBBox> </MDBTypography>\r\n  <p></p>\r\n  </MDBCol>\r\n  \r\n  <MDBRow>\r\n  <MDBCol > <MDBTypography note noteColor='warning'>  <MDBTypography blockquote className=\"text-left\">\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://realtymyths.com/goa-influence-portugal-india/\" target=\"_blank\">Goa – Influence of Portugal in India</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.holidify.com/pages/history-of-goa-65.html#\" target=\"_blank\">History of Goa - How Portuguese & Southern Influences Built the State</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/the-portuguese-legacy-asia\" target=\"_blank\">The Portuguese Legacy in Asia</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.treebo.com/blog/famous-churches-in-goa/\" target=\"_blank\">21 OF THE BEST & FAMOUS CHURCHES IN GOA TO CONSIDER VISITING</a></li>\r\n    \r\n  </ul>  </MDBTypography></MDBTypography></MDBCol></MDBRow>\r\n\r\n</MDBContainer>\r\n);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default gridExamplesPage;","D:\\Udemy courses\\HTML5, CSS3, Jquery, Javascript\\Projects\\React project website\\goa-porto-1\\src\\components\\GoaWorld.js",["369","370","371","372"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { MDBTypography, MDBContainer, MDBRow, MDBCol, MDBBox } from \"mdbreact\";\r\nimport './GoaWorld.css'; //Import here your file style\r\nimport Footer from './Footer';\r\nimport { MDBMask, MDBView} from \"mdbreact\";\r\n\r\nconst gridExamplesPage = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n<>\r\n       \r\n        <h2 className=\"heading\">Bem-vindo à nossa coluna de notícias entre Goa e o mundo!</h2>\r\n  \r\n     \r\n      \r\n    <MDBContainer   className=\"contentbox\">\r\n\r\n    <MDBRow>\r\n            <MDBCol  md=\"6\"> <MDBTypography blockquote bqColor='success'>\r\n            <MDBBox tag='p' mb={0} className='bq-title'>Welcome to our column on news between Goa and the world!</MDBBox> <MDBBox tag=\"footer\" mb={3} className=\"blockquote-footer\">by Ezekiel Carvalho <cite title=\"Source Title\"><p>Published on 3rd February 2021</p></cite></MDBBox></MDBTypography>\r\n           <p  className=\"historytext\">In this column we try to analyze and scrutinize on the various though latest news developments in Goa's relation to the world. </p> <p className=\"historytext\">This time, we endesvour to look upon a recent development in Goa wherein the people of Goa won and secured their desire from the BJP Government's personal agenda in intending to take over land in the area of Melaulim, which is used mainly in the field of agriculture, and instead use it for the field of IIT.

On January 6, the villagers locked heads with the police when the land was demarcated. The conflict resulted in the residents being lathicharged and exposed to tear gas. The CM had the final say in concluding that the villagers in Melauli were \"misguided\". He claimed that the project was a non-polluting project with the aim of education. He endeavoured to convince the people but according to him, \"some people\" worked against the interests of the state.

The state's Tourism Ministry in December 2020, they alluded that the tourism industry in Goa might have suffered losses between $273 million (€222 million) and $985 million (€801 million) as a result of the COVID pandemic. To top that off, there was job losses at the range of 35%-58%.</p> <p>\r\n             The typical tourism season in Goa (December and January), which is supposed to cause Goa to have a peak of tourists, more so from the Northern Indian state as a result of the drop in climate, many of these people flock Goa to bask in the hot sun in the beaches, unfortunately faced a severe blow due to COVID. The International tourists who come are mainly from Russia, Israel, the UK and Italy, often stay for months in Goa.</p> <p> This time, in December, there was no usual flow of crowds. Beaches in Goa carried an abandoned look, and the local businesses in these areas grappled to survive as a result of the drop in tourists.</p><p>A case in point was a woman who for almost 18 years, moved to Goa from a neighbouring state (Karnataka) every October. She is known for making accessories to sell at the beach. She apparently earns more than what she does as a farmer in Karnataka. She has been married for seven years, and is 25 years old with 3 children.</p>\r\n           \r\n            \r\n            </MDBCol>\r\n          </MDBRow>\r\n          <MDBRow>\r\n    <MDBCol > <MDBTypography note noteColor='success'>  <MDBTypography blockquote className=\"text-center\">\r\n    <p>\"We were under lockdown for nearly eight months, which meant no income.
